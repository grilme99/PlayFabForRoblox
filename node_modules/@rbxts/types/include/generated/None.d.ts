	/** Determines if an `Instance` can be cloned using [Instance.Clone](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/Clone) or saved to file.
	 * 
	 * This property determines whether an object should be included when the game is published or saved, or when [Instance.Clone](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/Clone) is called on one of the objects ancestors. Calling Clone directly on an object will return nil if the cloned object is not archivable. Copying an object in Studio (using the 'Duplicate' or 'Copy' options) will ignore the Archivable property and set Archivable to true for the copy.
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local part = Instance.new("Part")
	 * print(part:Clone()) --&gt; Part
	 * part.Archivable = false
	 * print(part:Clone()) --&gt; nil
	 * ```
	 * 
	 */
	Archivable: boolean;
	/** A non-unique identifier of the `Instance`.
	 * 
	 * This property is an identifier that describes an object. Names are not necessarily unique identifiers however; multiple children of an object may share the same name. Names are used to keep the object hierarchy organized, along with allowing scripts to access specific objects.
	 * 
	 * The name of an object is often used to access the object through the data model hierarchy using the following methods:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local baseplate = workspace.Baseplate
	 * local baseplate = workspace["Baseplate"]
	 * local baseplate = workspace:FindFirstChild("BasePlate")
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * In order to make an object accessible using the dot operator, an object's Name must follow a certain syntax. The objects name must start with an underscore or letter. The rest of the name can only contain letters, numbers, or underscores (no other special characters). If an objects name does not follow this syntax it will not be accessible using the dot operator and Lua will not interpret its name as an identifier.
	 * 
	 * If more than one object with the same name are siblings then any attempt to index an object by that name will return the only one of the objects found similar to [Instance.FindFirstChild](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/FindFirstChild), but not always the desired object. If a specific object needs to be accessed through code, it is recommended to give it a unique name, or guarantee that none of its siblings share the same name as it.
	 * 
	 * Note, a full name showing the instance's hierarchy can be obtained using [Instance.GetFullName](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/GetFullName).
	 */
	Name: string;
	/** The Parent property determines the hierarchical parent of the `Instance`. The following terminology is commonly used when talking about how this property is set:
	 * 
	 *   - An object is a **child** (**parented to**) another object when its Parent is set to that object.
	 * 
	 *   - The **descendants** of an `Instance` are the children of that object, plus the descendants of the children as well.
	 * 
	 *   - The **ancestors** of an `Instance` are all the objects that the Instance is a descendant of.
	 * 
	 * It is from this property that many other API members get their name, such as [GetChildren](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/GetChildren) and [FindFirstChild](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/FindFirstChild).
	 * 
	 * The [Remove](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/Remove) function sets this property to nil. Calling [Destroy](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/Destroy) will set the Parent of an `Instance` and all of its descendants to `nil`, and also **lock** the Parent property. An error is raised when setting the Parent of a destroyed object.
	 * 
	 * This property is also used to manage whether an object exists in the game or needs be be removed. As long as an objects parent is in the `DataModel`, is stored in a variable, or is referenced by another objects property, then the object remains in the game. Otherwise, the object will automatically be removed. The top level `DataModel` object (the one referred to as the `game` by scripts) has no parent, but always has a reference held to it by the game engine, and exists for the duration of a session.
	 * 
	 * Newly created objects using `Instance.new` will not have a parent, and usually will not be visible or function until one is set. The most elementary creation of an object has two steps: creating the object, then setting its parent.
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * -- Create a part and parent it to the workspace
	 * local part = Instance.new("Part")
	 * part.Parent = workspace
	 * -- Instance new can also take Parent as a second parameter
	 * Instance.new("NumberValue", workspace)
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * # Object Replication
	 * 
	 * An object created by server will not replicate to clients until it is parented to some object that is replicated. When creating an object then setting many properties, it's recommended to **set Parent last**. This ensures the object replicates once, instead of replicating many property changes.
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local part = Instance.new("Part") -- Avoid using the second parameter here
	 * part.Anchored = true
	 * part.BrickColor = BrickColor.new("Really red")
	 * -- Potentially many other property changes could go here here...
	 * -- Always set parent last!
	 * part.Parent = workspace
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * However, if you were parenting your parts to a `Model` whose parent hasn't been set yet, then setting the parent first would not matter as the model would not have replicated yet.
	 */
	Parent: Instance | undefined;
	/** This function destroys all of an `Instance`'s children.
	 * 
	 * As [Instance.Destroy](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/Destroy) also calls itself on the children of an object it is used on, this function will destroy all descendants.
	 * 
	 * ## Alternatives to ClearAllChildren
	 * 
	 * If the developer does not wish to destroy all descendants, they should use [Instance.GetChildren](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/GetChildren) or [Instance.GetDescendants](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/GetDescendants) to loop through an object and select what to destroy. For example, the following code sample will destroy all parts in an object.
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * for _, instance in pairs(object:GetDescendants()) do
	 * 	if instance:IsA("BasePart") then
	 * 		instance:Destroy()
	 * 	end
	 * end
	 * ```
	 * 
	 */
	ClearAllChildren(this: Instance): void;
	/** Create a deep copy of a Roblox Instance and all of its descendants, with all the same property values. Returns a new, separate object whose Parent property is `nil`. The next step after cloning an object is setting the Parent, and optionally re-positioning the new object if it has 3d geometry.
	 * 
	 * Any references to objects not in the cloned hierarchy are maintained (i.e. if an ObjectValue refers to an external object it will refer to the same external object). Any internal references are relative (ie if an ObjectValue refers to an internal object it will refer to a similar internal object in the copy).
	 * 
	 * Any objects in the cloned object's hierarchy (including the object itself) that does not have the `Archivable` property enabled are ignored. If the root object is not Archivable, the function returns `nil`.
	 * 
	 * Clone is useful for regenerating models by saving the original and spawning copies. It's also useful for taking a snapshot of the current state of a model if it is changing over time.
	 */
	Clone(this: Instance): this;
	/** Sets the [Instance.Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) property to nil, locks the [Instance.Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) property, disconnects all connections and calls Destroy on all children. This function is the correct way to dispose of objects that are no longer required. Disposing of unneeded objects is important, since unnecessary objects and connections in a place use up memory (this is called a **memory leak**) which can lead to serious performance issues over time.
	 * 
	 * **Tip:** After calling Destroy on an object, set any variables referencing the object (or its descendants) to nil. This prevents your code from accessing anything to do with the object.
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local part = Instance.new("Part")
	 * part.Name = "Hello, world"
	 * part:Destroy()
	 * -- Don't do this:
	 * print(part.Name) --> "Hello, world"
	 * -- Do this to prevent the above line from working:
	 * part = nil
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * Once an `Instance` has been destroyed by this method it cannot be reused because the [Instance.Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) property is locked. To temporarily remove an object, set [Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) it to nil instead. For example:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * object.Parent = nil
	 * wait(2)
	 * object.Parent = workspace

If the optional recursive argument is true, this function searches all descendants rather than only the immediate children of the `Instance`. Use this function if your code cannot guarantee the existence of an object with a given name.
	 * 
	 * ## Checking the Existence of An Object
	 * 
	 * FindFirstChild is necessary if you need to verify an object something exists before continuing. Attempting to index a child by name using the dot operator throws an error if the child doesn't exist.
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 *  -- The following line errors if Part doesn't exist in the Workspace:
	 * workspace.Part.Transparency = .5
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * Use FindFirstChild to first check for Part, then use an if-statement to run code that needs it.
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local part = workspace:FindFirstChild("Part")
	 * if part then
	 * 	part.Transparency = .5
	 * end
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * ## Finding a Child Whose Name Matches a Property
	 * 
	 * Sometimes the [Name](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Instance/Name) of an object is the same as that of a property of its [Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent). When using the dot operator, properties take precedence over children if they share a name.
	 * 
	 * In the following example, a `Folder` called "Color" is added to a `Part`, which also has the [Part.Color](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Color) property. `Part.Color` refers to the [datatype.Color3](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Color3), not the Folder.
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local part = Instance.new("Part")
	 * local folder = Instance.new("Folder")
	 * folder.Name = "Color"
	 * folder.Parent = part
	 * local c = part.Color --> A Color3
	 * local c2 = part:FindFirstChild("Color") --> The Folder
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * A benefit of using FindFirstChild in this way is that the introduction of new properties does not impose a risk on your code.
	 * 
	 * **Tip:** If you only need to use the result of a FindFirstChild call once, such as getting the property of a child if it exists, you can use the following syntax with the `and` operator:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local myColor = workspace:FindFirstChild("SomePart") and workspace.SomePart.Color
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * If SomePart exists, `myColor` will contain the Color of SomePart. Otherwise, it'll be nil without throwing an error. This works due to short-circuiting: Lua ignores the right side if the left is nil/false
	 * 
	 * ## Performance Note
	 * 
	 * FindFirstChild takes about 20% longer than using dot operator, and almost 8 times longer than simply storing a reference to an object. Therefore, you should avoid calling FindFirstChild in performance dependent code, such as in tight loops or functions connected to [RunService.Heartbeat](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/RunService/Heartbeat)/[RunService.RenderStepped](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/RunService/RenderStepped). **Store the result in a variable,** or consider using [ChildAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Instance/ChildAdded) or [WaitForChild](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/WaitForChild) to detect when a child of a given name becomes available.

	/** IsA returns true if the `Instance`'s class is **equivalent to** or a **subclass** of a given class. This function is similar to the **instanceof** operators in other languages, and is a form of [type introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection). To ignore class inheritance, test the [ClassName](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Instance/ClassName) property directly instead.

	 * 
	 * Most commonly, this function is used to test if an object is some kind of part, such as `Part` or `WedgePart`, which inherits from `BasePart` (an abstract class). For example, if your goal is to change all of a [Character](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/Character)'s limbs to the same color, you might use [GetChildren](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/GetChildren) to iterate over the children, then use IsA to filter non-`BasePart` objects which lack the `BrickColor` property:

	 * ```lua

	 * 
	 * ## Where should I use WaitForChild?
	 * 
	 * WaitForChild is extremely important when working on code ran by the client. Roblox does not guarantee the time or order in which objects are replicated from the server to the client. This can cause scripts to break when indexing objects that do not exist yet.
	 * 
	 * For example, a `LocalScript` may access a `Model` in the `Workspace` called 'Ship' like so:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local ship = workspace.Ship
	 * -- Will error if ship hasn't replicated
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * However if the model 'Ship' has not replicated to the client when this code is ran an error will be returned breaking the `LocalScript`.
	 * 
	 * Another alternative is using [Instance.FindFirstChild](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/FindFirstChild). Not only is this good practice when indexing objects in the `DataModel` (as it avoids accidentally accessing properties) but it does not break if the object does not exist. For example:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local ship = workspace:FindFirstChild("Ship")
	 * -- Won't error, but ship will be nil if the ship hasn't replicated
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * Here, if the model doesn't exist the code will not error. Instead the value ship will be equal to nil. This is better, but still not much good if we want to use the ship model.
	 * 
	 * Instead WaitForChild should be used:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local ship = workspace:WaitForChild("Ship")
	 * -- Will wait until the ship has replicated before continuing
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * Here, the thread will be yielded until the ship model has been found. This means the ship model can be used as soon as it is ready.
	 * 
	 * ## Notes
	 * 
	 *  - If a call to this function exceeds 5 seconds without returning, and no *timeOut* parameter has been specified, a warning will be printed to the output that the thread may yield indefinitely
	 * 
	 *  - This function will return immediately without yielding if the child exists when the call is made
	 * 
	 *  - WaitForChild is less efficient than [Instance.FindFirstChild](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/FindFirstChild) or the dot operator. Therefore it should only be used when the developer is not sure if the object has replicated to the client. Generally this is only the first time the object is accessed

	 * 	-- Don't manipulate the parent of descendant in this function!
	 * 	-- This event fires BECAUSE the parent of descendant was manipulated,
	 * 	-- and the change hasn't happened yet, i.e. this function fires before that happens.
	 * 	-- Therefore, it is problematic to change the parent like this:
	 * 	descendant.Parent = game
	 * end)

	/** This function returns an [event](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=RBXScriptSignal) similar to the [AnimationTrack.KeyframeReached](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/AnimationTrack/KeyframeReached) event, except it only fires when a specified `KeyframeMarker` has been hit in an [animation](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Animation). The difference allows for greater control of when the event will fire.
	 * 
	 * This event allows a developer to run code at predefined points in an animation (set by `Keyframe` names). This allows the default functionality of Roblox animations to be expanded upon by adding things such as [Sounds](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Sound) or [ParticleEffects](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/ParticleEmitter) at different points in an animation.
	 * 
	 * To learn more about using this function, see **Animation&nbsp;Events** in the [Using the Animation Editor](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=using%20animation%20editor) article.
	 * 
	 * ## Using the Returned Event
	 * 
	 * The RBXScriptSignal (event) returned by this can be connected to another function. The connection creates a [DataType.RBXScriptConnection](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=RBXScriptConnection) listener that executes the connected function every time the animation hits the specified KeyframeMarker until disconnected using Disconnect().
	 * 
	 * ## More about Keyframes
	 * 
	 * `Keyframe` names do not need to be unique. For example, if an Animation has three keyframes named "Particles" the connected event returned by this function will fire each time one of these keyframes is reached.
	 * 
	 * `Keyframe` names can be set in the Roblox Animation Editor when creating or editing an animation. They cannot however be set by a `Script` on an existing animation prior to playing it.

/** A Beam object connects two `Attachment`s by drawing a texture between them.
 * 
 * ## Setting up a Beam
 * 
 * To display, beams must be a descendant of the `Workspace` with their [Beam.Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment0) and [Beam.Attachment1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment1) properties set to `Attachment`s also descending from the `Workspace`.
 * 
 * The beam's appearance can be customised using the range of properties available.
 * 
 * ## Beam Curvature
 * 
 * Beams are configured to use a cubic [Bézier curve][1]. This means they are not constrained to straight lines, and the curve of the beam can be modified by changing [Beam.CurveSize0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/CurveSize0), [Beam.CurveSize1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/CurveSize1) and the orientation of the beam's `Attachment`s.
 * 
 * Cubic Bézier curves are formed of four control points. They are determined as follows:
 * 
 *  - **P0**: The start of the beam, the position of [Beam.Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment0)
 * 
 *  - **P1**: [Beam.CurveSize0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/CurveSize0) studs away from [Beam.Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment0), in [Beam.Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment0)'s positive X direction.
 * 
 *  - **P2**: [Beam.CurveSize1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/CurveSize1) studs away from [Beam.Attachment1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment1), in [Beam.Attachment1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment1)'s negative X direction.
 * 
 *  - **P3**: The end of the beam, the position of [Beam.Attachment1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment1)
 * 
 * The beam starts at P0, goes towards P1, and arrives at P3, from the direction of P2. The beam will not necessarily pass through P1 and P2.

	 * ```lua
	 * local colorSequence = ColorSequence.new({
	 * 	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0, Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)), -- red

	 * 
	 * This property is a [DataType.NumberSequence](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=NumberSequence), allowing the transparency to be configured to vary across the length of the `Beam`.

 * ## Forces Relative to Parent
 * 
 * Using the `CFrame:vectorToWorldSpace(Vector3)` method, it is possible to translate a force vector that is relative to the part into the world vector necessary for [Force](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyForce/Force). For example, to apply a force to the left an object (no matter which way it's facing), try:

 * 
 * Like all `CFrame`-type properties, the [BodyGyro.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyGyro/CFrame) property isn't editable in the Properties window in Studio. Since there's no physical component to a BodyGyro, you should use the Command bar or another scripting method to set the CFrame.

For example:
 * 
 * `workspace.Part.BodyGyro.CFrame = workspace.Part.CFrame`
 * 
 * You can also use a CFrame constructor which initializes rotation, such as: `CFrame.fromAxisAngle`, `CFrame.fromEulerAnglesXYZ` or `CFrame.fromEulerAnglesYXZ`. Beware of [gimbal lock][7] as you decide on the method and angles (in radians). Additionally, you could use `CFrame.new(gyro.Parent.Position, targetPosition)` in order to have the BodyGyro "look at" a `targetPosition`.
 * 
 * ## Troubleshooting
 * 
 * * If your part isn't moving at all, the assembly most likely has mass larger than what the BodyGyro can move. Try raising the [MaxTorque](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyGyro/MaxTorque) and/or [P](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyGyro/P) (power) properties. You should also check that no [Anchored](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Anchored) parts are within the assembly or in the way of the assembly.
 * 
 * * If your part isn't moving on all axes, double check the axis in question has sufficient [BodyGyro.MaxTorque](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyGyro/MaxTorque). Alternatively, if the part allows movement on an axis and shouldn't, be sure the MaxTorque is nonzero on that axis and refine the manner in which you are setting the BodyGyro's [CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyGyro/CFrame).
 * 
 * * If your part is moving too quickly, consider raising the [D](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyGyro/D) (dampening) property.
 * 
 * * If your part is moving too slowly, consider lowering the [D](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyGyro/D) (dampening) property. Also consider raising the [MaxTorque](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyGyro/MaxTorque) and/or [P](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyGyro/P) (power) properties.

/** The Camera object defines a view of the 3D game world. In an instance of the game, each client has its own Camera object associated with it. Camera objects exist only upon the viewer's client, residing in that user's local Workspace, and therefore cannot be edited directly from the server. As of the most recent versions of the game, the only way to access a client's Camera object is through a LocalScript running on that client. Each client's particular Camera object can be accessed through the [CurrentCamera](https://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=CurrentCamera) property of its local Workspace, assuming your code is running on that specific client.
 * 
 * A camera's state is defined in the following way:
 * 
 * * The [Camera.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Camera/CFrame) property, represents the the position and orientation of the camera.
 * 
 * * The [Focus](https://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=Focus) property represents the point the camera is looking at. It's important to set this property, as it also represents where the game thinks you are in the world. Certain visuals will be more detailed and will update more frequently, depending on how close they are to the Focus. Roblox's default [CameraScript](https://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=CameraScript) will take care of this for you.
 * 
 * * The [CameraType](https://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=CameraType) property represents what action the game engine should perform on the Camera every frame.
 * 
 * * The [FieldOfView](https://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=FieldOfView) property, a number, represents the angle the user can see out the sides of the Camera.
 * 
 * * An internal roll amount, which can be set by using the [SetRoll](https://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=SetRoll) method. This number (in radians) represents the angle in which the camera is rotated.

interface Camera extends Instance {
	/** The string representing the class this Instance belongs to. `classIs()` can be used to check if this instance belongs to a specific class, ignoring class inheritance. */
	readonly ClassName: "Camera";
	/** This property is the [DataType.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=CFrame) of the `Camera` and definies its position and orientation in the 3D world.
	 * 
	 * Some transformations, such as the rotation of the head when using VR devices are not reflected in this property. For this reason, developers should use [Camera.GetRenderCFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Camera/GetRenderCFrame) to obtain the ‘true’ [DataType.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=CFrame) of the `Camera`.
	 * 
	 * ## How to set the Camera's CFrame
	 * 
	 * You can move the  `Camera` by setting the CFrame property. However, the default [camera scripts][1] also set the CFrame property. When manually setting the CFrame property, it may be overwritten by the [camera scripts][1] which update every frame. There are two options to address this:
	 * 
	 *  1. Set the `Camera` [Camera.CameraType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Camera/CameraType) to *'Scriptable'*. When the `Camera` is *'Scriptable'* the default scripts will not update the CFrame. This method is simplest and recommended in most cases
	 * 
	 *  2. Replace the default [camera scripts][1] with an alternative that doesn't interfere with the developer's desired implementation. This is only recommended when developers do not need any default `Camera` functionality
	 * 
	 * ## How the Camera CFrame works
	 * 
	 * Like all [CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=CFrame) data, the `Camera` CFrame represents a position and an orientation.
	 * 
	 * The most intuitive way to position and orientate the `Camera` is by using the *new* [DataType.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=CFrame) constructor with the *pos* and *lookAt* parameters, for example:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local pos = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
	 * local lookAt = Vector3.new(10, 0, 0)
	 * local cameraCFrame = CFrame.new(pos, lookAt)
	 * workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame = cameraCFrame
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * In the above example the `Camera` is positioned at *0, 10, 0* and oriented to be looking towards *10, 0, 0*.
	 * 
	 * ## Animating the Camera CFrame
	 * 
	 * Although the `Camera` can be placed in the manner demonstrated above, you may want to animate the Camera to smoothly move from one [DataType.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=CFrame) to another. For this, there are a number of options:
	 * 
	 *  1. Creating a `Tween` using `TweenService` that animates the CFrame property of the `Camera`. See the code sample below for an example of this
	 * 
	 * 2. Setting the `Camera` CFrame every frame with [RunService.BindToRenderStep](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/RunService/BindToRenderStep) and the *lerp* [DataType.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=CFrame) method

	 * 
	 *  - For all [CameraTypes](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Camera/CameraType) but *'Scriptable'*, the object whose position the [Camera's](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Camera) [Camera.Focus](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Camera/Focus) will be set to
	 * 
	 * CameraSubject accepts a variety of [Instances](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Instance). The default [camera scripts][1] respond differently to different CameraSubject types:
	 * 
	 *  - `Humanoid`: By default the CameraSubject is set to the [LocalPlayer's](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Players/LocalPlayer) `Humanoid`. The camera scripts will follow the `Humanoid` factoring in the [Humanoid's](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Humanoid) current state and [Humanoid.CameraOffset](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/CameraOffset)
	 * 
	 *  - `BasePart`: The camera scripts will follow the position of any `BasePart`, with a vertical offset in the case of [VehicleSeats](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/VehicleSeat)
	 * 
	 * You can configure the `Camera` to follow a `Model` by setting the CameraSubject to the model’s [Model.PrimaryPart](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Model/PrimaryPart).
	 * 
	 * The CameraSubject cannot be set to *nil*. If it is, it will revert to its previous value.
	 * 
	 * To restore the CameraSubject to its default value, set it to the [LocalPlayer's](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Players/LocalPlayer) `Humanoid` like so:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local Players = game:GetService("Players")
	 * 
	 * local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer
	 * 
	 * local function resetCameraSubject()

	 * 
	 *  - Fixed: `Camera` is stationary
	 * 
	 *  - Follow: `Camera` moves with the [Camera.CameraSubject](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Camera/CameraSubject) and rotates to keep the subject in the center of view

	 *  - Custom: Default
	 * 
	 *  - Scriptable: No default behavior. Used by developers to script custom behavior
	 * 
	 * The above only applies when you use the default Roblox [camera scripts][1]. If you write your own camera scripts, you can choose to listen to CameraType and implement your own behaviors or ignore the property entirely.
	 * 
	 * ## Manually controlling the Camera
	 * 
	 * In some cases you may wish to manually control the `Camera` (for example during a cut-scene). The best way to do this is by setting the CameraType to *'Scriptable'*. The default [camera scripts][1] will not move or update the `Camera` on its own if CameraType is set to *’Scriptable’*. This means you can freely modify the `Camera` using its properties and functions. For more information on positioning and orientating the `Camera` manually see the [Camera.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Camera/CFrame) page.
	 * 
	 * If you want complete control over the camera at all times, you may replace the default [camera scripts][1] with your own.

	 * The default Roblox [camera scripts][1] automatically set the Focus to follow the [Camera.CameraSubject](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Camera/CameraSubject) (usually a `Humanoid`). However, Focus will not be automatically updated in the following cases:
	 *

	 * 
	 *  - When the default [camera scripts][1] are not being used

	 * ## Disabling HeadLocked
	 * 
	 * You are recommended not to disable HeadLocked for the following reasons:
	 * 
	 *  - Players may experience motion sickness if an equivalent head tracking solution is not added
	 * 
	 *  - The Roblox engine performs latency optimizations when HeadLocked is true
	 * 
	 * However in some circumstances you may wish to develop your own head tracking systems. For example, you may want custom camera transformations that restrict or augment the [DataType.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=CFrame) of the head.

 * A Pants object parented to a model will display the pants on the model provided a `Humanoid` is present and the limbs required for the pants corresponding with the humanoid's [Humanoid.RigType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/RigType) exist.
 * 
 * Note if multiple Pants objects are present in a model only one will be shown. However both a `Shirt` and Pants object will be shown together with the shirt drawn on top (as pants also cover the torso).
 * 
 * Pants automatically load onto new characters spawning based on the [Player.CharacterAppearance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/CharacterAppearance) property.
 * 
 * ## How do I make Pants?
 * 
 * In order to make a pants a texture (image) determining what will be displayed on what limbs needs to be uploaded to the Roblox website. For more information, please see [this tutorial][1].

/** The `CollectionService` manages groups (collections) of instances with tags. Tags are sets of strings applied to objects that replicate from the server to the client and in Team Create. They are also serialized when places are saved. At the moment, tags are not visible within Roblox Studio except with the use of a tag-editing plugin.
 * 
 * The primary use of `CollectionService` is to add flags and/or behaviors to Roblox objects. If you find yourself adding the same script to many different objects, perhaps a script that uses CollectionService would be better. Here are a couple examples:
 * 
 * * In an obstacle course with many bricks that kill players, don't paste the same script in all your kill bricks! Instead, tag them with "KIllBrick". Then, have any brick tagged as such kill the player.
 * 
 * * Payers with a VIP game pass could have their `Humanoid` tagged "VIP", and be allowed through doors that only allow VIPs.
 * 
 * * When creating a freeze-tag game, you could tag frozen players' `Humanoid` objects with a "Frozen" tag. Then, use a `LocalScript` to listen for the "Frozen" tag and create client-side visual effects to reduce the number of objects replicated from server to client.
 * 
 * When working with collections and tags, it's a good idea to use an [object-oriented programming style][1]. In almost all situations, tagged objects have their own identity, state and behavior. The pattern goes like this: when a tag is found ([CollectionService.GetTagged](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/CollectionService/GetTagged) and [CollectionService.GetInstanceAddedSignal](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/CollectionService/GetInstanceAddedSignal)), create a Lua object with the Roblox instance. When it is removed ([CollectionService.GetInstanceRemovedSignal](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/CollectionService/GetInstanceRemovedSignal)), call a cleanup/destroy method within the Lua object. See the code samples for a better idea of how this can be done.
 * 
 * When tags replicate, **all tags on an object replicate at the same time**. Therefore, if you set a tag on an object from the client then add/remove a **different** tag on the same object from the server, the client's local tags on the object are overwritten.
 *

/** The Configuration object is a container object that is designed to hold value objects to make values used in `Tool`s or any model using `Script`s more accessible.
 * 
 * ## How does the Configuration object work?
 * 
 * The Configuration object is just a container, and does not automatically offer any additional functionality to a `Folder`.
 * 
 * Configurations should hold value objects (`BrickColorValue`, `NumberValue`, `IntValue`, `ObjectValue` etc). These value objects should be read by the `Script` or `LocalScript` associated with the configuration to determine constants such as damage, speed or color.
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 * ```lua
 * local damage = 10
 * ```
 * 
 * Becomes:
 * 
 * ```lua
 * local configuration = tool:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Configuration", true)
 * damage = configuration:FindFirstChild("Damage").Value -- A NumberValue
 * ```
 * 
 * The Configuration object is intended to be placed inside a `BasePart` in a `Model` or `Tool`. It was originally intended to be used with a tool that provided a GUI interface to edit these properties. However it is more common now for developers to edit these values directly in the Roblox Studio properties window.
 * 
 * ## Why should I use the Configuration object?
 * 
 * Use of Configurations is optional, but a number of developers chose to use them for the following reasons.
 * 
 *  - Variables held in a Configuration can be found quickly and are in a single place
 * 
 *  - When sharing your work, others can make changes without needing to modify your code
 * 
 *  - Provides a single location for variables read by multiple scripts in more complex games

/** The ContextActionService is a game service that allows a game to bind user input to contextual actions, or actions that are only enabled under some condition or period of time. For example, allowing a player to open a door only while close by. In code, an action is simply a string (the name of the action) used by the service to differentiate between unique actions. The string is provided to BindAction and UnbindAction, among other member functions. If two actions are bound to the same input, the most recent takes priority. When the most recent action is unbound, the one bound before that takes control again.
 * 
 * You can inspect the currently bound actions in the developer console under the "Action Bindings" tab. You'll also see bindings from the Roblox engine too. This is useful in checking if your actions are binding/unbinding at the correct times, or if some other action is stealing input from your actions. For exmaple, if you are attempting to bind WASD, it may be the case that character movement scripts is binding over those same keys.
 * 
 * ContextActionService is especially useful for supporting keyboard-less players, in which on-screen touch buttons can be used in place of key presses. The buttons will display only when the action is bound, and the position, text and/or images of these buttons can be configured through this service.
 * 
 * It's better to use ContextActionService's BindAction than UserInputService's InputBegan for most cases. For example, if you want to use the `R` key to reload a weapon while it is equipped, the player might type "roblox is fun" in chat or otherwise use the `R` key for something else. The weapon could reload when the player didn't mean to! If you instead use BindAction and UnbindAction when the weapon is equipped/unequipped, ContextActionService will make sure that `R` key presses trigger the reload action only when it is the most recently bound action.

/** The CylinderMesh object applies a 'cylinder' mesh to the `BasePart` it is parented to.
 * 
 * What does a CylinderMesh do?
 * 
 * ----------------------------
 * 
 * A CylinderMesh gives the `BasePart` it was applied to a cylinder shaped mesh.
 * 
 * The mesh applied gives the same appearance as that due to the [SpecialMesh.MeshType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SpecialMesh/MeshType) of a `SpecialMesh` being set to 'Cylinder' or [Part.Shape](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Part/Shape) being set to 'Cylinder'. However, unlike those two cases, it is orientated so that the height of the cylinder is along the `BasePart`'s Y axis.
 * 
 * The dimensions of the mesh scale relative to the [BasePart.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Size) of the `BasePart`. This scale is uniformly along the `BasePart`'s Y axis and maintaining a 1:1 ratio for the part’s X and Z axis, using the lowest value. This means the `BasePart` can be resized normally, but the cross section of the cylinder will always remain a circle and cannot be stretched or compressed.
 * 
 * Note as the CylinderMesh object does not include a texture the [DataModelMesh.VertexColor](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/VertexColor) property does not do anything.
 * 
 * ## Why use a CylinderMesh?
 * 
 * The advantage of using a mesh over setting the [Part.Shape](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Part/Shape) property of a part to 'Cylinder' is that the [DataModelMesh.Scale](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/Scale) and [DataModelMesh.Offset](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/Offset) properties are exposed. These allow the position and dimensions of the mesh that is displayed to be changed without changing the [BasePart.Position](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Position) or [BasePart.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Size) of the `Part` the mesh is parented to.
 * 
 * The key difference between a CylinderMesh or a `SpecialMesh` with [SpecialMesh.MeshType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SpecialMesh/MeshType) set to 'Cylinder' is the orientation of the cylinder mesh. With a CylinderMesh, the height of the cylinder is aligned with the height (Y axis) of the part. With a `SpecialMesh` (or `Part` with [Part.Shape](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Part/Shape) set to 'Cylinder'), the height of the cylinder is aligned with the X axis.

	 * 
	 * ## How can I change the texture of a mesh?
	 * 
	 * Using the TextureId property, the texture of a mesh can be changed without having to reupload the mesh. To do this, a new image will need to be uploaded to Roblox with the desired texture. The original texture image file can be obtained by exporting the mesh using the 'Export Selection' option in Roblox Studio. The image file will be saved alongside the exported .obj file.
	 * 
	 * The new texture can then be re-uploaded to Roblox as a Decal and its content ID can be applied to the mesh using the TextureId property.
	 * 
	 * ## How can I make a textured mesh?
	 * 
	 * A mesh can only be textured if the mesh has been UV mapped. UV mapping refers to the practice of projecting a texture map onto a mesh. This cannot be done using Roblox Studio and has to be done using an external 3D modelling application such as [Blender][1].

/** The SpecialMesh is an object that allows developers to provide a standard template or user uploaded mesh to a `BasePart`.
 * 
 * ## What does a SpecialMesh do?
 * 
 * The SpecialMesh object applies a mesh to a `BasePart` depending on the the [SpecialMesh.MeshType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SpecialMesh/MeshType) property. A number of options are available.
 * 
 *  - **Brick** - A block shape, equivalent to a `BlockMesh`
 * 
 *  - **Cylinder** - A cylinder, identical to a `Part` with a [Part.Shape](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Part/Shape) of 'Cylinder'
 * 
 *  - **FileMesh** - A user uploaded Mesh, equivalent to `FileMesh` that a texture can be applied to using the [FileMesh.TextureId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/FileMesh/TextureId) property
 * 
 *  - **Head** - A character head shape
 * 
 *  - **Sphere** - A sphere shape, similar to a `Part` with a [Part.Shape](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Part/Shape) of 'Ball' but can be freely resized on all axis
 * 
 *  - **Wedge** - A wedge shape, identical to a `WedgePart`
 * 
 *  - **Torso** - A block with sloped sides, due to be deprecated
 * 
 * Note, each [SpecialMesh.MeshType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SpecialMesh/MeshType) will scale differently when using [DataModelMesh.Scale](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/Scale), for more information on this please see the page on [DataModelMesh.Scale](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/Scale). The SpecialMesh object also exposes the [DataModelMesh.Offset](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/Offset) property.
 * 
 * It is important to remember that when using a SpecialMesh, only the appearance of a part changes. The collision model of the part remains the same. For example, a character will not be able to walk correctly over a mesh as the mesh geometry is not taken into account.
 * 
 * ## SpecialMesh or MeshPart?
 * 
 * There are currently two ways of using a developer created mesh. They are using a SpecialMesh with the [SpecialMesh.FileType](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=FileType) set to 'FileMesh', or by using a `MeshPart`. Although, on the whole, the `MeshPart` object has superseded the SpecialMesh there are some differences developers should be aware of.
 * 
 *  - [BasePart.Material](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Material) displays correctly on the mesh when using a `MeshPart` and not when using a SpecialMesh
 * 
 *  - `MeshPart`s include the [MeshPart.CollisionFidelity](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=CollisionFidelity) property, meaning the collision model of a `MeshPart` can be set to resemble the geometry of the mesh. The SpecialMesh object by contrast, uses the parent `BasePart`s collision model
 * 
 *  - The mesh of a `MeshPart` scales on all axis depending on the [Size](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Size) property of the `MeshPart`, the mesh of a SpecialMesh does not
 * 
 *  - The SpecialMesh object includes the [Offset](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/Offset) and [Scale](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/Scale) properties whereas `MeshPart`s do not
 * 
 *  - The [MeshId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/FileMesh/MeshId) property of a `SpecialMesh` can be changed by a `Script` or `LocalScript` during runtime. The [MeshId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/MeshPart/MeshId) property of a `MeshPart` can not.
 * 
 * In most, but not all cases, using a `MeshPart` is more suitable. As `MeshPart`s are a relatively new feature however, developers should expect some of the above behaviour to change.
 * 
 * ## Uploading a custom mesh
 * 
 * Although a developer uploaded mesh can be used on a `SpecialMesh`, meshes can currently only be be uploaded using `MeshPart`s or the game explorer. For more information on how to do this please see [this tutorial](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Mesh%20Parts).

 * 
 * Take the example of projectile that has just been thrown. On first thought, it could be cleaned up using:
 * 
 * ```lua
 * wait(3)
 * projectile:Destroy()
 * ```
 * 
 * However there are a number of issues with this approach. Firstly, it requires yielding the code with a wait, which is not always desirable. Secondly, before the 3 seconds have elapsed the object may have already been destroyed (for example, if it reached [Workspace.FallenPartsDestroyHeight](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Workspace/FallenPartsDestroyHeight)). In this case, the code would error as it tries to destroy an item that has already been destroyed. One answer may be:
 * 
 * ```lua
 * delay(3, function()
 * 	if projectile and projectile.Parent then
 * 		projectile:Destroy()
 * 	end
 * end)
 * ```
 * 
 * This solves the above issues, as it spawns a new thread to prevent the current one from yielding and checks to see if it can be destroyed. However at this point a simple command has already become quite complicated and an unnecessary thread is being created.
 * 
 * This is where Debris comes in, and the following code addresses all of the above issues.
 * 
 *     Debris:AddItem(projectile, 3)

 *

If this effect is not desired, try hiding the parent object at a far away position, then removing the Fire after a few seconds using `Debris` to give the last particles a chance to expire. This object does not have a [ParticleEmitter.Clear](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Clear) method, but it is possible to set the [Instance.Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) to nil and back to the exact same object for the same effect.
 * 
 * Fire particles are only emit from the center of `BasePart` to which they are parented. The particles are emit toward the top (+Y) direction; however, a negative [Fire.Heat](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Fire/Heat) may be used to emit in the bottom (-Y) direction. Parenting a Fire object to an `Attachment` instead allows customization of the particles' start position and emission direction.

 * 
 * The Folder object is ideal for organizing and storing objects. It is not recommended to use folders to group `BasePart`s as `Model`s offer a range of useful functions for moving and manipulating the parts.
 *

 * 
 * ```lua
 * local folder = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):FindFirstChild("Folder")
 *  local subFolder = folder:FindFirstChild("Folder")
 * ```
 *

See below for a simple example of how folders can be used to organize game objects in `ReplicatedStorage`.

/** A `ForceField` protects a `Humanoid` from taking damage using the [Humanoid.TakeDamage](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Humanoid/TakeDamage) function, and protects `BasePart`s from having their joints broken due to an `Explosion`.
 * 
 * ## ForceField Creation
 * 
 * ForceFields are created when a character spawns on a `SpawnLocation` and the [SpawnLocation.Duration](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SpawnLocation/Duration) property is greater than zero.
 * 
 * ForeFields influence the instance they are parented to. When parented to a `Model` they will protect all of the `BasePart`s descending from that model. They may be parented to a `BasePart`, but the part's joints will only be protected if both the part and the part it is connected to also contain ForceField.
 * 
 * ## Forcefields and Joints
 * 
 * When a ForceField is parented to a character `Model` the neck joint will be protected and thus the character can not be killed by `Explosions`. Developers can protect joints from Explosions without the need for a `ForceField` object by setting [Explosion.DestroyJointRadiusPercent](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Explosion/DestroyJointRadiusPercent) to 0.
 * 
 * **ForceFields and Damage**
 * 
 * ForceFields only protect `Humanoid`s from damage using the [Humanoid.TakeDamage](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Humanoid/TakeDamage) function. Humanoids can still be damaged by setting [Humanoid.Health](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/Health) directly. For this reason, it is advised that developers use [Humanoid.TakeDamage](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Humanoid/TakeDamage). Bearing in mind of course, that it is still possible to check if a `ForceField` exists before manually setting the humanoid's health as shown below:
 * 
 * ```lua
 * if not characterModel:FindFirstChildOfClass("ForceField") then
 * 	humanoid.Health = humanoid.Health - 10
 * end
 * ```
 * 
 * ## ForceField Visuals
 * 
 * When [ForceField.Visible](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ForceField/Visible) is set to true, a particle effect is created. A number of rules determine where this effect will be emitted from.
 * 
 * When parented to a `Model`, if the model includes a `Humanoid` named “Humanoid” with [Humanoid.RigType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/RigType) set to R15, the effect will be emitted from the part named “UpperTorso”. Otherwise, the effect will be emitted from the part named “Torso”. The part must have the same parent as the ForceField, if it does not exist then the effect is emitted at 0, 0, 0.
 * 
 * When parented to a `BasePart` the effect will be emitted from the part's [BasePart.Position](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Position).

It should be noted that `GuiObject` can have negative sizes and render normally, though [GuiObject.AnchorPoint](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiObject/AnchorPoint) ought to be used to better control rendering.
 * 
 * To manipulate the layout of a GuiObject in special ways, you can use a `UIComponent` class such as `UIListLayout`, `UIPadding` or `UIScale`.
 * 
 * This class defines very simple animation methods: [GuiObject.TweenPosition](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/GuiObject/TweenPosition), [GuiObject.TweenSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/GuiObject/TweenSize) and [GuiObject.TweenSizeAndPosition](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/GuiObject/TweenSizeAndPosition) are good alternatives to `TweenService` for beginners.
 * 
 * GuiObject also defines events for user input like [GuiObject.MouseEnter](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/MouseEnter), [GuiObject.TouchTap](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchTap), [GuiObject.InputBegan](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/InputBegan), [GuiObject.InputChanged](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/InputChanged) and [GuiObject.InputEnded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/InputEnded).

Although it is possible to detect mouse button events on any GuiObject using [GuiObject.InputBegan](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/InputBegan), only `ImageButton` and `TextButton` have dedicated events for these (e.g. [TextButton.MouseButton1Down](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=MouseButton1Down)).

/** A [GUI](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GuiObject) that can display children 3D objects inside its viewport. Children objects will not be rendered in the main scene. Background color is transparent.
 * 
 * This is a great way to display 3D objects/models in a 2D&nbsp;GUI space like a `ScreenGui`.
 * 
 * ![ViewportFrame Catalog][1]
 * 
 * ![ViewportFrame Model][2]
 * 
 * ### Caveats
 * 
 *   - Currently 3D objects can only be displayed on [ScreenGuis](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/ScreenGui) or [PluginGuis](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/PluginGui)
 * 
 *   - Objects inside ViewportFrames are rendered using a fixed [lighting](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Lighting) setting
 * 
 *   - No shadow or post effects are available. Neon and Glass [materials](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Material) will be rendered on lowest quality
 * 
 * ### Using ViewportFrames
 * 
 * #### Through Studio UI
 * 
 *  1. Add a ViewportFrame into a [GuiLayerCollector](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/LayerCollector), such as a ScreenGui or `SurfaceGui`. This will cause a blank UI element to appear in the main window.
 * 
 * ![ScreenGui->ViewportFrame in Explorer][3]
 * 
 * ![Empty ViewportFrame in Workspace][4]
 * 
 *  2. Add a model that you want to show in the ViewportFrame into `Workspace`. Target your camera towards the [model](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Model).
 * 
 * ![Model being displayed by ViewportFrame][5]
 * 
 *  3. Set [ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ViewportFrame/CurrentCamera) to Workspace.Camera. Drag the model into the ViewportFrame. The model should show up there.
 * 
 * ![ScreenGui->ViewportFrame->Model in Explorer][6]
 * 
 * ![ViewportFrame Rendering Model][7]
 * 
 *  4. You can change the size, position or other properties of ViewportFrame like other GUIs. Now the CurrentCamera is a reference to the main camera in Workspace, so if you move the camera in the main scene, it will also affect ViewportFrame. When you find a good position, duplicate the camera and make sure it is not the one Workspace is using. Then set it to ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera so the camera won’t be changed by Workspace operations.
 * 
 * ![Gif of ViewportFrame Rendering Model][8]
 * 
 * #### Through Scripts
 * 
 * You can also set up a ViewportFrame using scripts. Add the following `LocalScript` into a ScreenGui (or other proper Guis), run the game and you will get a [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/BasePart) rendered inside a ViewportFrame.
 * 
 * ```lua
 * local vf = Instance.new("ViewportFrame", script.Parent)
 * vf.Size = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)
 * vf.Position = UDim2.new(0.25, 0, 0.25, 0)
 * vf.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(1, 1, 1)
 * 
 * local part = Instance.new("Part", vf)
 * part.Position = Vector3.new(0, 0, 0)
 * 
 * local camera = Instance.new("Camera", vf)
 * vf.CurrentCamera = camera
 * 
 * local cameraPosition = Vector3.new(3, 3, 3)
 * camera.CFrame = CFrame.new(cameraPosition, part.Position)
 * ```
 * 
 * ![ViewportFrame rendering Part from LocalScript][9]

 * 
 * If the limit of 500 http [GET](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/HttpService/GetAsync) / [POST](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/HttpService/PostAsync) requests per minute is exceeded, the Service will stall entirely for approximately 30 seconds.
 * 
 * ## Enabling HTTP requests
 * 
 * HttpService starts off as disabled by default.
 * 
 * To [enable](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/HttpService/HttpEnabled) HTTP requests, the HttpService must be enabled through Studio's Game Settings by opening the game's settings via the `Game Settings` button on the `Home` tab of the game's studio window.

	 * 
	 * | Name | Type | Required | Description |
	 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
	 * | **Url** | string | yes | The target URL for this request. Must use `http` or `https` protocols. |
	 * | **Method** | string | no | The HTTP method being used by this request, most often GET or POST. |
	 * | **Headers** | dictionary | no | A dictionary of headers to be used with this request. Most HTTP headers are accepted here, but not all. |
	 * | **Body** | string | no | The request body. Can be any string, including binary data. Must be excluded when using the GET or HEAD HTTP methods. It might be necessary to specify the `Content-Type` header when sending JSON or other formats. |
	 * 
	 * ### HTTP Headers
	 * 
	 * In the request dictionary, you can specify custom HTTP headers to use in the request. However, some headers cannot be specified. For example, `Content-Length` is determined from the request body. `User-Agent` and `Roblox-Id` are locked by Roblox. Other headers like `Accept` or `Cache-Control` use default values but can be overridden. More commonly, some REST APIs may require API keys or other service authentication to be specified in request headers.
	 * 
	 * This method does not detect the format of body content. Many web servers require the `Content-Type` header be set appropriately when sending certain formats. Other methods of `HttpService` use the [HttpContentType](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=HttpContentType) enum; for this method set the `Content-Type` header appropriately: [text.plain](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=plain), [text.xml](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=xml), [application.xml](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=xml), [application.json](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=json) or [application.x-www-form-urlencoded](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=x-www-form-urlencoded) are replacement `Content-Type` header values for the respective enum values.
	 * 
	 * ## Response Dictionary Fields
	 * 
	 * The function returns a dictionary containing the following fields:
	 * 
	 * | Name | Type | Description |
	 * | --- | --- | --- |
	 * | **Success** | boolean | The success status of the request. This is true if and only if the **StatusCode** lies within the range [200, 299]. |
	 * | **StatusCode** | integer | The HTTP response code identifying the status of the response. |
	 * | **StatusMessage** | string | The status message that was sent back. |
	 * | **Headers** | dictionary | A dictionary of headers that were set in this response. |
	 * | **Body** |  | The request body (content) received in the response. |
	 * 
	 * ## Error Cases
	 * 
	 * This method raises an error if the response times out or if the target server rejects the request. If a web service goes down for some reason, it can cause scripts that use this method to stop functioning altogether. It is often a good idea to wrap calls to this method in `pcall` and gracefully handle failure cases if the required information isn't available.
	 * 
	 * ## Limitations
	 * 
	 * The current limitation for sending and receiving HTTP requests is 500 requests per minute. Requests over this threshold will fail. Additionally, Roblox domains are blacklisted. This means that HTTP requests cannot be sent to any Roblox owned site, such as [www.roblox.com][3].
	 *

/** The Humanoid is a special object that gives models the functionality of a character. It grants the model with the ability to physically walk around and interact with various components of a Roblox level.
 * 
 * Humanoids are always parented inside of a `Model`, and the model is expected to be an assembly of `BasePart` and `Motor6D`; the root part of the assembly is expected to be named _HumanoidRootPart_ . It also expects a part named _Head_ to be connected to the character's torso part, either directly or indirectly.
 * 
 * By default, there are two official types of character rigs supplied by Roblox, each with their own set of rules:
 * 
 * ### R6
 * 
 * * A basic character rig that uses 6 parts for limbs.
 * 
 * * The _Head_ part must be attached to a part named _Torso_, or the Humanoid will die immediately.
 * 
 * * BodyPart appearances are applied using `CharacterMesh` objects.

 * * Certain properties, such as [Humanoid.LeftLeg](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/LeftLeg) and [Humanoid.RightLeg](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/RightLeg), only work with R6.
 * 
 * ### R15
 * 
 * * More complex than R6, but also far more flexible and robust.
 * 
 * * Uses 15 parts for limbs.
 * 
 * * The _Head_ part must be attached to a part named _UpperTorso_ or the Humanoid will die immediately.
 * 
 * * BodyPart appearances have to be assembled directly.
 * 
 * * Can be dynamically rescaled by using special `NumberValue` objects parented inside of the Humanoid.
 * 
 * * The Humanoid will automatically create `Vector3Value` objects named _OriginalSize_ inside of each limb.
 * 
 * * If a NumberValue is parented inside of the Humanoid and is named one of the following, it will be used to control the scaling functionality:
 * 
 * * BodyDepthScale
 * 
 * * BodyHeightScale
 * 
 * * BodyWidthScale

	 * When a Humanoid's parent `BaseModel` has a part named *Head*, a visual display of the `Player`'s name and health is drawn 1.5 studs above the character's head. This visual display is known as the **Humanoid Display**.
	 * 
	 * This property is set using the [Enum.HumanoidDisplayDistanceType](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=HumanoidDisplayDistanceType) enum. There are three available values for this property, each with their own set of rules:

	 * 
	 * ---
	 * 
	 * When the DisplayDistanceType is set to **Viewer**, the humanoid display's visibility is locally controlled by the NameDisplayDistance and HealthDisplayDistance of each Player in the game. For instance, if a player has their display distance properties set to 50, and everyone else has their display distance properties set to 100,  then that player will not be able to see the name and health of the humanoid at a distance greater than 50 studs, while everyone else can still see the name and health of the humanoid up to a distance of 100 studs.
	 * 
	 * ![Viewer example][1]
	 *

This means the distance the information will be displayed will be taken from the humanoid that is viewing them. In this case, the player character (who is in the foreground) has its HealthDisplayDistance set to 10 and NameDisplayDistance set to 20. The health bar is only visible on the closest NPC because it is within 10 studs, and the names of only the two closer NPCs are visible because they are within 20 studs.

	 * 
	 * ![Subject example][2]
	 * 
	 * In this example all of the NPC characters have their DisplayDistanceType set to Subject. This means the view distance of their information will depend on their individual HealthDisplayDistance and NameDisplayDistance properties.
	 * 
	 * * The NPC on the left has its HealthDisplayDistance and NameDisplayDistance set to 10. Since the NPC is 15 studs away, neither of the displays are visible.

	 * 
	 * ![The default health bar displayed in Roblox's top bar][3]
	 * 
	 * From the perspective of a Player, their character will never display the standard humanoid name &amp; health label. Instead, it is displayed in the top right corner of the screen. The health bar will only be shown when the character's health isn't full.
	 * 
	 * The player's character also has a default script inserted into it called **Health**, that regenerates their health by 1% continuously every second, until it is restored to full health.

	 * ----------
	 * 
	 * ## Damaging Humanoids ##
	 * 
	 * ![ForceFields make you immune to explosions!][4]
	 * 
	 * When making Humanoids take damage, you are advised to utilize the Humanoid's TakeDamage function. The TakeDamage function properly ignores damage when the Humanoid's character model has a ForceField parented inside of it.
	 * 
	 * The ForceField object makes the character immune to explosions and is expected to make them immune to damage as well. You are allowed to just subtract from the Humanoid's health, but it ultimately depends on whether or not you incorporate ForceFields into your game.
	 * 
	 * ----------
	 * 
	 * ## Out of Health! ##
	 * 
	 * ![The same Humanoid from the beginning, after being bloxxed by an explosion.][5]
	 * 
	 * When the value of the character's health reaches 0, the Humanoid will automatically change into its *Dead* state, which makes the character break its joints and fall into pieces.
	 * 
	 * If there is a joint connecting the Head part to the character, the Head **must** remain connected to the character, such that `Head:GetRootPart() == Humanoid.RootPart`. You can think of the joint connection as the character's neck. If you don't have a neck between your head and torso, you are very dead.

	 * Although the Humanoid.Touched event is useful, developers should consider if there are alternatives that suit their needs better before using it.
	 * 
	 *  - In most cases it is advised to connect a [BasePart.Touched](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/BasePart/Touched) event for [BaseParts](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/BasePart) of interest instead. This is because the Humanoid Touched event will constantly fire when the humanoid is moving. For example, in a dodgeball game it would be more practical to connect a touched event for the balls rather than the humanoid
	 * 
	 *  - For developers trying to work out when the `Humanoid` has landed on the ground, the [Humanoid.StateChanged](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Humanoid/StateChanged) event is more suitable. Alternatively, developers can use [Humanoid.FloorMaterial](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/FloorMaterial) to see if the `Humanoid` is standing on anything
	 * 
	 * ## Notes
	 * 
	 *  - Connecting to this event will cause a `TouchTransmitter` to be created in every limb
	 * 
	 *  - The is currently no equivalent of [BasePart.TouchEnded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/BasePart/TouchEnded) for [Humanoids](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Humanoid)

/** An object created when an input begins that describes a particular user input, such as mouse movement, touches, keyboard, and more.
 * 
 * The object's properties vary according the the type of input. Properties can be used to determine input [state](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=UserInputState), [type](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=UserInputType), [position](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Vector3), [delta](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Vector3), and the [Enum.KeyCode](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=KeyCode) that triggered the input (if applicable).
 * 
 * Once created at the beginning of an input, the same object persists and is updated until the input ends. As a result, you can track the object's changes using the [Changed](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Instance/Changed) event as the user changes the input in question. You can also place these objects into a list of active inputs track and interact with the object after it's creation by an event such as [UserInputService.InputBegan](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/UserInputService/InputBegan).

/** A Keyframe holds the `Pose`s applied to joints in a `Model` at a given point of time in an animation. `Keyframe`s are interpolated between during animation playback.

 * Note, in most cases developers do not need to manipulate `KeyframeSequence`s as the animation editor covers most animation functionality. However, in some cases a developer may wish to generate an animation from a `Script` or build their own plugin.
 * 
 * **Structure**
 * 
 * Keyframes are held within a `KeyframeSequence` and contain `Pose` objects. The poses are named in accordance with the `BasePart`s they correspond to and are structured in terms of joint hierarchy. This means each `Pose` is parented to the `Pose` corresponding to the part it is attached to. See below for a visual example.
 * 
 * ![][1]
 * 
 * Note, as `Pose`s are named in accordance with the `BasePart`s they correspond to, animations require distinct part names to play correctly.
 * 
 * **Interpolation**
 * 
 * During animation playback the poses in different keyframes are interpolated between. This allows a smooth animation to be created without needing to define every frame. Note, the style of interpolation is determined in the `Pose` object. The Keyframe object merely holds the `Pose`s at a defined point of time in the animation ([Keyframe.Time](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Keyframe/Time)).

/** A KeyframeMarker is an instance meant to represent an event that will eventually be fired when a `Keyframe` is hit.
 * 
 * ## Using a KeyframeMarker
 * 
 * KeyframeMarkers should always be parented to a Keyframe via setting the parent directly or using the [Keyframe.AddMarker](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Keyframe/AddMarker) function of Keyframe. KeyframeMarkers can also be removed directly or using the [Keyframe.RemoveMarker](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Keyframe/RemoveMarker) function, and polled to check which markers are attached to a specific Keyframe using [Keyframe.GetMarkers](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Keyframe/GetMarkers).
 * 
 * Whenever a Keyframe is detected as an animation is running, there will be an event fired for each KeyframeMarker that is parented to the Keyframe. These events are identifiable by the name of the KeyframeMarker. You can retrieve and listen to these events using the [AnimationTrack.GetKeyframeMarkerReached](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=GetKeyframeMarkerReached) function. Optionally, you may set the [KeyframeMarker.Value](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/KeyframeMarker/Value) property of the KeyframeMarker in order to pass along a value with the event being fired.
 * 
 * It inherits the [Keyframe.Name](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Instance/Name) property from `Instance` and behaves identically. Names are used for identification and no not need to be unique. When multiple KeyFrameMarkers with the same name are attached to a KeyFrame, events such as the one returned by [AnimationTrack.GetMarkerReachedSignal](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/AnimationTrack/GetMarkerReachedSignal) will fire for every marker.

/** This object stores all the `Keyframe`s for an animation, determines if the animation is looped, and determines its priority against other animations.
 * 
 * ## What is a Keyframe Sequence?
 * 
 * The animation data Roblox uses in the playback of an animation, referenced by the [Animation.AnimationId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Animation/AnimationId) property, is constructed from a KeyframeSequence. Every animation has a KeyframeSequence associated with it. KeyframeSequences are usually created by the Roblox Animation Editor but can be created through other plugins or even manually. Once uploaded to Roblox, their Content ID is used for the [Animation.AnimationId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Animation/AnimationId) property.
 * 
 * Note, in most cases developers do not need to manipulate KeyframeSequences as the animation editor covers most animation functionality. However, in some cases a developer may wish to generate an animation from a `Script` or build their own plugin.
 * 
 * ## KeyframeSequence Properties
 * 
 * The priority and looped animation settings are set by [KeyframeSequence.Priority](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/KeyframeSequence/Priority) and [KeyframeSequence.Loop](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/KeyframeSequence/Loop). Note these can be eventually overwritten by the `AnimationTrack` properties.
 * 
 * The length of an animation is determined by the last `Keyframe` in the sequence, meaning the `Keyframe` with the highest [Keyframe.Time](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Keyframe/Time) property.
 * 
 * ## KeyframeSequence Structure
 * 
 * KeyframeSequences are a container that hold `Keyframe`s. Keyframes represent a 'key' frame in the animation, that are interpolated between during playback.
 * 
 * Keyframes contain `Pose`s. `Pose`s are specific to each `BasePart` being animated and contain the `CFrame` applied to the `Motor6D` connecting to the part. Poses are named according to the `BasePart` they correspond with. For this reason, animations require distinct part names to play correctly.
 * 
 * Poses are structured based on joint hierarchy. Each `Pose` is parented to the `Pose` corresponding to the part it is attached to. In practice, this means the poses branch out from the root part. See below for a visual example.
 * 
 * ![][1]
 * 
 * ## Using KeyframeSequences when making animations
 * 
 * KeyframeSequences must be first uploaded to Roblox before they can be played. This can be done by right clicking on the KeyframeSequence and clicking 'Save to Roblox'. Alternatively, [Plugin.SaveSelectedToRoblox](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Plugin/SaveSelectedToRoblox) can be used. This will bring up the animation upload window.
 * 
 * In some cases, a developer may want to preview an Animation before uploading it to the Roblox site. This can be achieved by generating a temporary id using [KeyframeSequenceProvider.RegisterKeyframeSequence](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/KeyframeSequenceProvider/RegisterKeyframeSequence). This will generate a hash id that can be used for localized animation testing.
 * 
 * ## Obtaining KeyframeSequences
 * 
 * In some cases the developer may wish to download the KeyframeSequence corresponding to an existing uploaded Animation. This can be done so using [KeyframeSequenceProvider.GetKeyframeSequenceAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/KeyframeSequenceProvider/GetKeyframeSequenceAsync).

The effect of fog is it blends color with the FogColor.
	 * 
	 * At distances greater than [Lighting.FogEnd](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogEnd), color will be determined entirely by the FogColor. However at distances between [Lighting.FogStart](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogStart) and [Lighting.FogEnd](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogEnd) the degree to which the color is blended depends on the position.
	 * 
	 * Roblox's fog uses linear interpolation between [Lighting.FogStart](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogStart) and [Lighting.FogEnd](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogEnd). This means if [Lighting.FogStart](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogStart) is 10 and [Lighting.FogEnd](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogEnd) is 20, at a distance of 15 studs the fog will be at 50%.

	 * 
	 * ## What does GlobalShadows do?
	 * 
	 * When set to true, shadows are rendered in sheltered areas depending on the position of the sun and moon. The lighting hue applied to these areas is determined by the [Lighting.Ambient](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/Ambient) property. The lighting hue in all other areas is determined by the [Lighting.OutdoorAmbient](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/OutdoorAmbient) property.
	 * 
	 * When disabled, shadows are not drawn and no distinction is made between indoor and outdoor areas. As a result, the [Lighting.Ambient](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/Ambient) property determines the lighting hue and [Lighting.OutdoorAmbient](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/OutdoorAmbient) will do nothing.
	 * 
	 * Shadows are calculated using a voxel system, and each lighting voxel is 4x4x4 studs. This means objects need to be larger than 4x4x4 studs to display a realistic shadow. Shadows are also recalculated when `BasePart`s are moving.
	 * 
	 * Note, this property is unrelated to shadows from characters which are displayed regardless of what GlobalShadows is set to.
	 * 
	 * For more information about Roblox's dynamic lighting, please see this [blog post][1].
	 * 
	 * ## Toggling GlobalShadows
	 * 
	 * Developers toggling the GlobalShadows setting will notice that disabling it makes the place considerably darker. This is because when GlobalShadows is disabled [Lighting.Ambient](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/Ambient) is used to calculate the lighting hue in both indoor and ourdoor spaces. This darkness can be resolved by setting [Lighting.Ambient](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/Ambient) to a higher value such as [Lighting.OutdoorAmbient](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/OutdoorAmbient)'s default value of 127, 127, 127.
	 * 
	 * In most cases developers are recommended to leave GlobalShadows enabled due to the superior visual appearance. See the image below for a comparison.

The effective OutdoorAmbient value is clamped to be greater than or equal to [Lighting.Ambient](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/Ambient) in all channels. This means, if a channel of [Lighting.Ambient](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/Ambient) exceeds its corresponding OutdoorAmbient channel then the hue of [Lighting.Ambient](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/Ambient) will begin to apply to outdoor areas.

	 * Note, when [Lighting.GlobalShadows](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/GlobalShadows) is disabled there is no distinction between areas occluded from the sky and areas that are not.

	 * SetMinutesAfterMidnight allows a numerical value to be used, for example in a day/night cycle `Script`, without the need to convert to a string in the format required by [Lighting.TimeOfDay](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/TimeOfDay). It also allows values greater than 24 hours to be given that correspond to times in the next day. See the code snippets below for an example.
	 * 
	 * Using [Lighting.TimeOfDay](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/TimeOfDay) requires the time to be normalized and a string formatted:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * minutesAfterMidnight = 0
	 * while true do
	 * 	minutesAfterMidnight = minutesAfterMidnight + 1
	 * 
	 * 24)
	 * 60
	 * 	local hours = string.format("%02.f", math.floor(seconds/3600))
	 * 60)))
	 * 3600 - mins *60))
	 * 	local timeString = hours..":"..mins..":"..secs
	 * 
	 * 	Lighting.TimeOfDay = timeString
	 * 
	 * 	wait()
	 * end
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * Using [Lighting.ClockTime](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Lighting/ClockTime) requires the time to be normalized:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * minutesAfterMidnight = 0
	 * while true do
	 * 	minutesAfterMidnight = minutesAfterMidnight + 1
	 * 
	 * 24)
	 * 	local hours = minutesNormalised / 60
	 * 
	 * 	Lighting.ClockTime = hours
	 * 
	 * 	wait()
	 * end
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * Using [Lighting.SetMinutesAfterMidnight](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Lighting/SetMinutesAfterMidnight) requires no extra processing:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * minutesAfterMidnight = 0
	 * while true do
	 * 	minutesAfterMidnight = minutesAfterMidnight + 1
	 * 
	 * 	Lighting:SetMinutesAfterMidnight(minutesAfterMidnight)
	 * 
	 * 	wait()
	 * end
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * @param minutes The number of minutes after midnight.

/** A LocalizationTable is a database of translations. It contains source strings and translations for various languages. It is used with `Translator` and the `LocalizationService` auto-translator system to control text translations in the game.
 * 
 * LocalizationTables are designed to be treated as resources, like a texture or a script. They are not optimized to be modified at runtime. Changing a the contents of a table will cause the entire contents of the table to be replicated to all players.
 * 
 * ## LocalizationTable Entries
 * 
 * Each LocalizationTable contains a set of entries. Each entry contains the translations of the text, along with some special fields:
 * 
 * * **Key** is an optional unique key for fast hash lookups in code. If it is non-empty it must be unique in the table.
 * 
 * * **Source** is the orignal text in the source language that will be used by the `LocalizationService` automatic text replacement system to match GUI text and render a translation instead. The Source field can be filled by the text capture tools, or can be set manually. For key-based lookups the Source value can be used as a translation for [LocalizationTable.SourceLocaleId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/LocalizationTable/SourceLocaleId) if the entry doesn't have a translation for that locale. If Source is empty then the entry will not be used by the automatic replacement system.
 * 
 * * **Context** is the full Instance name for the object that the text appeared on. Context is used for disambiguation by the automatic text replacement system. When multiple matches for the Source are found, the system will pick the best match by matching backwards from the end of the Context string. There are other more robust ways to handle disambiguation available as well, like using multiple tables with [GuiBase2d.RootLocalizationTable](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiBase2d/RootLocalizationTable).
 * 
 * * **Example** is whatever you want it to be. If the text capture tool guessed some parameters for a string the Example field will contain an example of them used in context.
 * 
 * All of these fields are optional, but at least either Key or Source must be non-empty. No two entries can have the same Key, Source, and Context.
 * 
 * The **Source** field and all translation strings must be valid [LocalizationService format strings](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Format-Strings).

/** A ModuleScript is a type of Lua source container that runs once and must return exactly one value. This value is then returned by a call to `require` given the ModuleScript as the only argument. ModuleScripts run once and only once per Lua environment and return the exact same value for subsequent calls to `require`.
 * 
 * ModuleScripts are essential objects for adhering to the don't-repeat-yourself (DRY) principle. When you write a function, write it only once and use it everywhere. Having multiple copies of a function is disastrous when you need to change that behavior. So, you should define functions or groups of functions in ModuleScripts and have your Scripts and LocalScripts call `require` on your ModuleScripts. Keep your code organized!
 * 
 * It's important to know that return values from ModuleScripts are independent with regards to LocalScripts and Scripts, and other environments like the Command Bar. Using `require` on a ModuleScript in a LocalScript will run the code on the client, even if a Script did so already on the server. Similarly, in Roblox Studio, using `require` on a ModuleScript in the hierarchy with the Command Bar will give a similar behavior. So, be careful if you are using a ModuleScript on the client and server at the same time, or debugging it within Studio.
 * 
 * Note that the first call to `require` on a ModuleScript will not yield (halt) unless the ModuleScript yields (e.g. calls `wait`). The current thread that called `require` will yield until a ModuleScript returns a value. A run time error is generated if this doesn't happen. If a ModuleScript is attempting to `require` another ModuleScript that in turn tries to `require`s it, the **thread will hang and never halt (cyclic `require` calls do not generate errors).** Be mindful of your module dependencies in large projects!
 * 
 * If a ModuleScript object is has its Name property set to 'MainModule' and is uploaded to Roblox as a model to your account, Scripts can use `require` with the uploaded model's AssetId instead. This allows you to create private modules on your Roblox account!

 * 
 * MarketplaceService also has functions that fetch information about developer products ([GetProductInfo](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/MarketplaceService/GetProductInfo) and [GetDeveloperProductsAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/MarketplaceService/GetDeveloperProductsAsync)), game passes ([UserOwnsGamePassAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/MarketplaceService/UserOwnsGamePassAsync)), and other assets ([PlayerOwnsAsset](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/MarketplaceService/PlayerOwnsAsset)).
 * 
 * ## Monetization
 * 
 * Learning to use MarketplaceService is the first step towards learning to monetize a game on Roblox. Be extra mindful when using these features, as failed sales and sale-related bugs can be incredibly frustrating to deal with. Another important game service regarding monetization is `DataStoreService` which is responsible for saving and loading data like that of purchases. When processing purchases, it is often a good idea to check using data stores that a player hasn't already been granted a product. Remember: all of the current financial rules of Roblox apply to in-game sales. At the moment, members of Builders Club will earn 70% of the total cost of the transaction and 10% for affiliate gear sales. If you are not a Builders Club member, you instead earn 10% of the total cost of the transaction.
 * 
 * ## Purchase Prompt
 * 
 * Below is an example of an in-game developer product purchase prompt for a product called "XP Boost", with a price of R$ 25. The player is presented with the choice "Buy Now" or "Cancel". Upon confirming the purchase, the [ProcessReceipt](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/callback/MarketplaceService/ProcessReceipt) callback will be invoked with information about the purchase so the game may grant the product (in this case, the XP Boost). In studio, purchases will not charge the developer account and will be marked as such in the prompt.
 * 
 * ![A screenshot of the in-game purchase prompt asking "Want to buy the product XP Boost for R$ 25? This is a test purchase. Your account will not be charged "][PromptProductPurchase]
 * 
 * ## Sale Processing
 * 
 * Processing the sales of developer products is done by setting the [ProcessReceipt](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/callback/MarketplaceService/ProcessReceipt) callback once. This callback should grant the bonus associated with a developer product and return `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted`.

	/** This function provides information about an asset, developer product or game pass given its **assetId** and the [Enum.InfoType](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=InfoType) (Asset, Product or GamePass respectively).
	 * 
	 * Information about the queried item is provided in a dictionary with the following keys. Note that not all information is provided or necessarily relevant for the kind of object you are querying.
	 * 
	 * | Name | Type | Description |
	 * | --- | --- | --- |
	 * | `Name` | string | The name shown on the asset's page |
	 * | `Description` | string | The description as shown on the asset's page; can be nil if blank |

	 * | `Updated` | timestamp | Timestamp of when the asset was last updated by its creator, e.g. `2018-08-01T17:55:11.98Z` |
	 * | `ContentRatingTypeId` | number | Indicates whether the item is marked as 13+ in catalog |
	 * | `MinimumMembershipLevel` | number | The minimum Builder's Club subscription necessary to purchase the item |
	 * | `IsPublicDomain` | boolean | Describes whether the asset can be taken for free |
	 * |  **Creator Information** |
	 * | `Creator` | Dictionary | A table of information describing the creator of the asset (see following lines) |

	 * 
	 * ## Developer Product Example
	 * 
	 * The following example loads information about a developer product.
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local PRODUCT_ID = 336755544
	 * 
	 * local MarketplaceService = game:GetService("MarketplaceService")
	 * 
	 * local productInfo = MarketplaceService:GetProductInfo(PRODUCT_ID, Enum.InfoType.Product)
	 * 
	 * print("Product ID " .. PRODUCT_ID .. " name: " .. productInfo.Name) 
	 * 
	 * if productInfo.Description then
	 * 	print("Description: " .. productInfo.Description)
	 * else
	 * 	print("No description!")
	 * end
	 * 
	 * if productInfo.IsForSale then
	 * 	print("It is on sale for " .. productInfo.PriceInRobux .. " Robux.")
	 * end
	 * 
	 * print("The image icon is: rbxassetid://" .. productInfo.IconImageAssetId)
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * ## Use in Studio Plugins
	 * 
	 * This method is often used by plugins to detect old versions and notify the user to manually update a plugin. The plugin author uploads a dummy asset, such as a decal or model, then puts the present version of the plugin in that asset's description. The plugin then calls this method and checks an internal version number for a newer version.
	 * 
	 * ## Possible Errors
	 * 
	 * If no such item exists with the given ID, this function will throw an error:
	 * 
	 *  - For developer products, the error is:
	 * 
	 * > *MarketplaceService:getProductInfo() failed because rawProductInfo was empty*
	 * 
	 *  - For game passes and assets, the error is:
	 * 
	 * > *MarketplaceService:getProductInfo() failed because HTTP 0 (HTTP 400 (HTTP/1.1 400 BadRequest))*
	 * @param assetId The assetId of the specified product
	 * @param infoType An `Enum/InfoType` enum value specifying the type of information being retrieved
	 * @returns A dictionary containing information about the queried item (described in the table above). Note that not all information is provided or necessarily relevant for the kind of object you are querying

	 * 
	 * ## Caching Behavior
	 * 
	 * Results of this function are remembered so that repeated calls will return quicker. This function will always return true if the player owns the game pass upon first entering a server after having purchased the game pass. If the game pass is purchased in-game (through [PromptGamePassPurchase](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/MarketplaceService/PromptGamePassPurchase)), this function may return false due to the caching behavior. Conversely, should the player delete the game pass from their inventory, this function may return true despite the player not owning the game pass.
	 * 
	 * ## History
	 * 
	 * Previously, querying player ownership of game passes required the use of the now-deprecated [GamePassService.PlayerHasPass](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/GamePassService/PlayerHasPass) function. This was changed in April 2018 when [game passes received their own ID system](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/live-changes-to-game-passes/116918).
	 * 
	 * On [Release 350](https://developer.roblox.com/resources/release-note/Release-Note-for-350) (August 2018), this function was changed so that the result is cached. Previously, it made a request every time it was called.

/** The Mouse object is the code interface for the computer mouse.
 * 
 * ## How to get the Mouse?
 * 
 * A Mouse object is not createable, but can be obtained using the [Player.GetMouse](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Player/GetMouse), [Tool.Equipped](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Tool/Equipped). The `PluginMouse` object, which inherits from Mouse can be created using the `Plugin` [Plugin.GetMouse](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Plugin/GetMouse) function.
 * 
 * ```lua
 * local Players = game:GetService("Players")
 * local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer -- from a LocalScript
 * local mouse = Player:GetMouse()
 * ```
 * *
 * ```lua
 * Tool.Equipped:Connect(function(mouse)
 * 	-- got mouse
 * end)
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Mouse alternatives
 * 
 * There is a degree of overlap between the functionality offered by `ContextActionService`, `UserInputService` and the Mouse object.
 * 
 * Mouse, by and large, has been superseded by `UserInputService` which offers wider additional functionality for interacting with the mouse as well as other input types. For example:
 * 
 *  - `UserInputService` supports other inputs such as key presses and mobile inputs whereas `Mouse` does not
 * 
 *  - `UserInputService` includes additional mouse features such as [UserInputService.MouseBehavior](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/UserInputService/MouseBehavior) and [UserInputService.MouseDeltaSensitivity](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/UserInputService/MouseDeltaSensitivity)
 * 
 * In most cases developers are advised to use the new `UserInputService`. However the Mouse object remains supported for a number of reasons.
 * 
 *  - Mouse existed long before `UserInputService` and a large number of places and gear items are dependent on it
 * 
 *  - The `PluginMouse` object is still used by plugins accessing the mouse
 * 
 *  - The mouse object is embedded into `Tool`s and is easier to pick up for new developers

Most of the time, when documentation refers to a part, most BasePart implementations will work and not just `Part`.
 *

 * 
 *   - They may be grouped within a `Model`, which allows several BasePart to be moved at the same time using [SetPrimaryPartCFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Model/SetPrimaryPartCFrame).
 * 
 *   - A `Decal` applies a stretched image texture to the faces of a part, though the exact mapping depends on the type of part.
 * 
 *   - A `Texture` applies a tiled image texture to the faces of a part much like a `Decal`.
 * 
 *   - A `SurfaceGui` renders [GuiObjects](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GuiObject) on the face of a part.
 * 
 *   - An `Attachment` can be added to specify a CFrames relative to a parent BasePart. These are often used by physics `Constraint` objects, such as `RopeConstraint` and `HingeConstraint`.
 * 
 *   - `ParticleEmitter` emit particles uniformly in the volume of the BasePart to which they are parented.
 * 
 *   - Light objects like `PointLight` emit light from the center of a BasePart.
 * 
 *   - When [played](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Sound/Play), a `Sound` parented to a BasePart will be physically located at the part's position.
 * 
 *   - `BodyMover` objects like `BodyVelocity` exert forces on the BasePart to which they are parented.
 * 
 *   - As a sibling of a `Humanoid`, they can be used as limbs of a character and also animated when joined using `Motor6D`. If not a sibling of a `Humanoid`, BasePart can still be animated using an `AnimationController`.
 * 
 *   - In Studio, you can use most implementations of BaseParts with solid modelling.
 * 
 *   - If parented to a `Tool` and given the name "Handle", a BasePart can be held by characters.
 * 
 *   - You can make BasePart interactive by adding a `ClickDetector`
 * 
 *   - You can a mesh like a `BlockMesh` or `SpecialMesh` to change how a BasePart looks without change how it physically behaves.

/** ## What is a Part
 * 
 * The Part object is a physical object. When it is in the `Workspace`, it will move and interact with other Parts. It can have bonds formed with other Parts, so that the two Parts stay in the same relative position.
 * 
 * Parts are the basic building blocks of any Roblox place. Commonly known as **bricks**, you'll see these the most often of any other objects as almost every place is built out of these. It is possible to stretch a Part to very large sizes and use them for baseplates, or make them very small and use them to create cool looking `Tool`.
 * 
 * ## How can I edit a Part
 * 
 * The Part object can be edited using the various studio tools. It is available via either the insert menu, or the *Object Insert menu*. It can also be created using the function:
 * 
 * ```lua
 * Instance.new("Part")
 * ```
 * 
 * ## How do I create different shaped Parts
 * 
 * Using the Mesh objects, such as `SpecialMesh`, `BlockMesh`, or `CylinderMesh` objects you can change the shape of them. Using the `Decal` or `Texture` objects, you can place pictures on top of the bricks.
 * 
 * ## Changing Parts using scripts
 * 
 * There are many scripting opportunities using the Part object. Many of the other scripting objects, such as `BodyForce` objects operate inside of a Part or other physics based objects. Editing the Part's properties through a script can result in a lot of fun opportunities.

/** A type of `BasePart` that a player character can 'sit' in. When a character touches an enabled Seat object, it will be attached to the part by a `Weld` and the default character scripts will play a sitting animation.
 * 
 * ## How do Seats work?
 * 
 * When a model containing a `Humanoid` and a `BasePart` called 'HumanoidRootPart' (generally a player character) touches a seat, a `Weld` is created between the seat and the part. The [C0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/JointInstance/C0) and [C1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/JointInstance/C1) properties are configured so that the character is welded 2 studs above the seat. This weld is named 'SeatWeld' and parented to the seat.
 * 
 * When sitting the [Seat.Occupant](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Seat/Occupant) property is set to the `Humanoid` that is 'sitting' in the seat. Furthermore the [Humanoid.SeatPart](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/SeatPart) property of the humanoid is set to the seat.
 * 
 * A character can also be forced to sit in a seat using the [Seat.Sit](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Seat/Sit) function.
 * 
 * There are two ways for a character to get out of a seat. When a player jumps, they are removed from the seat. However this can also be done manually by destroying the seat weld, for example:
 * 
 *     seat:FindFirstChild("SeatWeld"):Destroy()
 * 
 * Note seats have a cooldown (currently 3 seconds) that is on a per-character per-seat basis. This means once a character has gotten out of a seat they cannot sit back on the same seat for 3 seconds. This cooldown behavior may change and should not be relied upon by developers.
 * 
 * ## What can Seats be used for?
 * 
 * Seats have a diverse range of uses, ranging from the obvious to the more unconventional.
 * 
 *  - Creating chairs or benches without the need for any programming
 * 
 *  - Allowing characters to 'sit' in moving objects such as vehicles without getting flung around
 * 
 *  - Creating interfaces that are controlled by the character in the seat using the [Seat.Occupant](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Seat/Occupant) property

/** MeshParts are a form of `BasePart` that includes a physically simulated custom mesh. Unlike with other mesh classes, such as `SpecialMesh` and `BlockMesh`, they are not parented to a `BasePart` but rather behave as a `BasePart` in their own right.
 * 
 * ## How do I use MeshParts
 * 
 * The mesh and texture of a MeshPart are determined by the [MeshPart.MeshId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/MeshPart/MeshId) and [MeshPart.TextureID](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/MeshPart/TextureID) properties. For more information on how to use MeshParts please see [here](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Mesh%20Parts).
 * 
 * ## SpecialMesh or MeshPart?
 * 
 * There are currently two ways of using a developer created mesh. They are using a `SpecialMesh` with the [SpecialMesh.FileType](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=FileType) set to 'FileMesh', or by using a MeshPart. Although, on the whole, the MeshPart object has superseded the SpecialMesh there are some differences developers should be aware of.
 * 
 *  - [BasePart.Material](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Material) displays correctly on the mesh when using a MeshPart and not when using a `SpecialMesh`
 * 
 *  - MeshParts include the [MeshPart.CollisionFidelity](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=CollisionFidelity) property, meaning the collision model of a MeshPart can be set to resemble the geometry of the mesh. The `SpecialMesh` object by contrast, uses the parent `BasePart`s collision model
 * 
 *  - The mesh of a MeshPart scales on all axis depending on the [BasePart.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Size) property of the MeshPart, the mesh of a `SpecialMesh` does not
 * 
 *  - The `SpecialMesh` object includes the [DataModelMesh.Offset](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/Offset) and [DataModelMesh.Scale](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/Scale) properties whereas MeshParts do not
 * 
 *  - The [DataModelMesh.MeshId](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=MeshId) property of a `SpecialMesh` can be changed by a `Script` or `LocalScript` during runtime. The [MeshPart.MeshId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/MeshPart/MeshId) property of a MeshPart can not
 * 
 * In most, but not all cases, using a MeshPart is more suitable. As MeshParts are a relatively new feature however, developers should expect some of the above behaviour to change.

	 * 
	 * ## How can I change the texture of a mesh?
	 * 
	 * Using the TextureId property, the texture of a mesh can be changed without having to reupload the mesh. To do this, a new image will need to be uploaded to Roblox with the desired texture. The original texture image file can be obtained by exporting the mesh using the 'Export Selection' option in Roblox Studio. The image file will be saved alongside the exported .obj file.
	 * 
	 * The new texture can then be re-uploaded to Roblox as a Decal and its content ID can be applied to the mesh using the TextureId property.
	 * 
	 * ## How can I make a textured mesh?
	 * 
	 * A mesh can only be textured if the mesh has been UV mapped. UV mapping refers to the practice of projecting a texture map onto a mesh. This cannot be done using Roblox Studio and has to be done using an external 3D modelling application such as [Blender][1].

/** Models are container objects, meaning they hold objects and group objects together. They are best used to hold collections of `BasePart`s and have a number of functions that extend their functionality.

/** The Workspace is the service in which any objects that are to be rendered in the 3D world exist. Objects not descending from Workspace will not be rendered or physically interact with the world.
 * 
 * ## What does the Workspace do?
 * 
 * The core job of the Workspace is to hold objects that exist in the 3D world, [BaseParts](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/BasePart) and [Attachments](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Attachment). Whilst such objects are descendant of Workspace, they will be active. For BaseParts this means they will be rendered, and physically interact with other parts and the world. For `Attachment`s this means objects adorned to them, such as [ParticleEmitters](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/ParticleEmitter), [Beams](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Beam) and [BillboardGuis](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/BillboardGui) will render.
 * 
 * Understanding this behavior is important, as it means objects can be removed from the Workspace when they are not needed. For example, map [Models](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Model) can be removed from the `Workspace` when a different map is being played on. Objects that are not immediately needed in the Workspace are generally stored in `ReplicatedStorage` or `ServerStorage`.
 * 
 * In its role as the holder of active 3D objects, Workspace includes a number of useful functions related to parts, their positions and joints between them. Commonly used are the Workspace's raycasting functions, such as [Workspace.FindPartOnRay](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Workspace/FindPartOnRay).
 * 
 * ## Accessing the Workspace
 * 
 * The Workspace can be accessed several ways, all of which are valid.
 * 
 * ```lua
 * workspace -- a global variable
 * game.Workspace -- a property of the DataModel
 * game:GetService("Workspace") -- workspace is a service
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Notes
 * 
 *  - Objects that require adornment, such as `ParticleEmitter`s and `BillboardGui`s will be adorned to the *0, 0, 0* position when adorned to the Workspace (parented to it without an adornee otherwise being set)
 * 
 *  - The [Model.MakeJoints](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Model/MakeJoints) and [Model.BreakJoints](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Model/BreakJoints) functions inherited from the `Model` class are overridden by the Workspace's own [Workspace.MakeJoints](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Workspace/MakeJoints) and [Workspace.BreakJoints](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Workspace/BreakJoints) functions, which can only be used in plugins
 * 
 *  - It is impossible to delete the Workspace
 * 
 *  - The Workspace will also clean up `BasePart`s that fall beneath [Workspace.FallenPartsDestroyHeight](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Workspace/FallenPartsDestroyHeight)
 * 
 *  - A client's current `Camera` object can be accessed using the [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Workspace/CurrentCamera) property
 * 
 *  - The `Terrain` object can be accessed using the [Workspace.Terrain](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Workspace/Terrain) property

If this property is set to nil, or the CurrentCamera is otherwise destroyed, a new `Camera` will be created and assigned. Developers should avoid setting this property to nil or destroying the CurrentCamera however as it can have unintended consequences.

	 * When looking for a client's `Camera` object, developers should use this property rather than looking for a child of `Workspace` named 'Camera'.
	 * 
	 * ## What can be done with CurrentCamera
	 * 
	 * Accessing a client's current `Camera` object brings a range of uses.

	 * 
	 *  - Bbjects parented to the `Camera` will not replicate to the server, regardless of what [Workspace.FilteringEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Workspace/FilteringEnabled) is set to.

	 * ![Parts being destroyed at the FallenPartsDestroyHeight][1]
	 * 
	 * ## What happens to falling parts?
	 * 
	 * For performance reasons, Roblox automatically destroys (using [Instance.Destroy](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/Destroy)) parts that fall below this value. This is to prevent parts that have fallen off the map from continuing to fall forever.

	 * 
	 * ## Notes
	 * 
	 *  - Developers should also use the `Debris` service to clean up parts that are no longer needed, but have not fallen off the map
	 * 
	 *  - This property is clamped between -50,000 and 50,000. This is because `BasePart`s do not simulate or render properly at a great distance from the origin due to floating point inaccuracies

	 * 
	 * ## What is network streaming?
	 * 
	 * Streaming is an opt-in feature builders can enable for their places. It'll allow places to have more `BasePart`s, faster join times, and allow more games to run on less powerful hardware. It does this by allowing games to be played whilst objects are still being downloaded, and removing objects that are no longer needed.
	 * 
	 * The downside of network streaming is it means the client can no longer rely on specific objects being available. Developers should not enable StreamingEnabled unless they understand its implications and have put processes in place to manage them. For example, `LocalScript`s may have to use [Instance.WaitForChild](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/WaitForChild) in order to access parts of the game.

When a force is applied to an non anchored `BasePart`, an 'awake' state will be applied. Whilst a `BasePart` is awake the Roblox physics engine will perform continuous calculations to ensure physical forces interact correctly with the part. Once the `BasePart` is no longer subject to physical forces, it will revert to a 'sleeping' state.

	 * 
	 * ## What is physics throttling?
	 * 
	 * Physics throttling occurs when the physics engine detects it cannot keep up with the game in realtime. When physics is being throttled, it will update less frequently causing `BasePart`s to appear to move slower.
	 * 
	 * Without throttling, the physics simulation would fall further behind out of sync with the game. This can lead to lower frame rates and other undesirable behavior.
	 * 
	 * Objects associated with `Humanoid`s are exempt from physics throttling.
	 * 
	 * See also [Workspace.SetPhysicsThrottleEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Workspace/SetPhysicsThrottleEnabled).
	 * 
	 * ## Demonstrating physics throttling
	 * 
	 * Developers should always avoid creating places that overload the physics engine, as it leads to sub-par experience for players. Those wishing to simulate physics throttling for research purposes however, need only create a lot of `Part`s very quickly.
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local i = 0
	 * while true do
	 * 	i = i + 1

This is generally done by comparing the result returned by a client's GetRealPhysicsFPS to a maximum that will not be breached in normal circumstances (usually 65 or 70). If this limit is breached, developers can use the [Player.Kick](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Player/Kick) function to remove that `Player` from the game.

/** A ParticleEmitter allows for the creation of [particle systems][1]. is a special effect object that emits customizable 2D billboard particles into the world. On Roblox, a particle is a 2D image rendered in the world so that it always always face the camera, much like a `BillboardGui` with a single `ImageLabel` in it.
 * 
 * ![A ParticleEmitter with default settings in a Part with default settings][2]
 * 
 * ParticleEmitter must be parented to a `BasePart` (such as a `Part`) or an `Attachment` within such a part. Particles spawn randomly in the **bounding box** of its parent part (for attachments, this is a single point). Particles from a single emitter will render so long as this condition is met; setting a ParticleEmitter's [Instance.Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) to nil will remove all particles instantly, like how [ParticleEmitter.Clear](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Clear) works. If an emitter is [ParticleEmitter.Enabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Enabled) and has a nonzero [ParticleEmitter.Rate](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Rate), it will emit particles on its own. Finer control on the number of particles can be accomplished using [ParticleEmitter.Emit](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Emit).
 * 
 * Roblox provides several pre-made particle effect objects - `Fire`, `Smoke` and `Sparkles`. They behave similarly to a ParticleEmitter, but they are not as customizable. They also lack certain particle-controlling methods: [ParticleEmitter.Emit](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Emit) and [ParticleEmitter.Clear](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Clear).  An `Explosion` also uses particles, but provides little-to-no control with regards to how the effect looks.
 * 
 * ## How to Insert a ParticleEmitter
 * 
 *  In Studio, a ParticleEmitter can be inserted in several ways:
 * 
 *   - Using the "Effects" drop-down (Model tab)
 * 
 *   - From the Advanced Objects window (In the model tab, or CTRL+I)
 * 
 *   - The add menu within the Explorer window
 * 
 *   - Using the Command bar, run `Instance.new("ParticleEmitter", workspace)`
 * 
 *   - If you find you are inserting ParticleEmitters often, you can add a ParticleEmitter button to the Quick Access toolbar

	/** The Transparency property determines the transparency in studs of all active particles over their individual lifetimes. It works similar to [ParticleEmitter.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Size) in how it affects particles over time. In terms of rendering, it works like the [BasePart.Transparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Transparency) of a part.
	 * 
	 * Pictured below are two default `ParticleEmitter`s. The right emitter has a Transparency set to a [DataType.NumberSequence](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=NumberSequence) that interpolates from 0 to 1.
	 * 
	 * ![Two default ParticleEmitters; the right emitter Transparency fades over the lifetime of the particles][1]
	 * 
	 * A particle’s present transparency is determined by linearly interpolating on this NumberSequence using the particle’s age and the particle’s total lifetime. For example, if a particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4 second lifetime, the transparency will be whatever is 50% of the way through the [DataType.NumberSequence](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=NumberSequence). For any [DataType.NumberSequenceKeypoint](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=NumberSequenceKeypoint) with a nonzero envelop value, a random value in the envelop range is chosen for each keypoint for each particle when it spawns.
	 * 
	 * Changing this property applies changes to all particles present in the system. This is because the transparency of a particle is determined using its present lifetime and this `NumberSequence` (the Transparency at the time the particle was emit is not stored on a per-particle basis).

	 * 
	 *  - The SourcePlaceId returned is guaranteed to be the place the data was sent from. This means you can verify the TeleportData came from an approved place
	 * 
	 * However, as this data is transmitted by the client, it not 100% secure. Although the user cannot modify this data it is possible for them to view it or insert data from a previous teleport.
	 * 
	 * Despite this, it is still appropriate for the secure transmission of [immutable data][1] (data that can not be changed). For example, if the user has completed a level that cannot be uncompleted. Such data can be securely transmitted using this function avoiding the need to use up and wait for [DataStore](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GlobalDataStore) requests when teleporting.
	 * 
	 * You should not use this function for data that can be changed. For example, the amount of in-game currency the user currently has.

For data like this, you should rely on [GlobalDataStores](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GlobalDataStore).

	 * 
	 * Using this event and some string manipulation functions like `string.sub` and `string.lower`, it is possible to create chat commands, even with arguments like player names. Usually, commands are prefixed such as `/heal PlayerName`. To check for a prefix in a string, use `string.sub` on the message to check a substring of the message: `string.sub(message, 1, 6) == "/heal "` (note the inclusion of the space) . Then, extract the rest of the command using `string.sub` again: `string.sub(message, 7)` will be equal to the player name. Check if that player exists, and if so, perform the command's action (in this example, healing them). Check the code samples for examples of chat commands.
	 * 
	 * ## Filtering
	 * 
	 * The message text fired with this event is **unfiltered**. If you are displaying player input like chat to other players in any form, it must be filtered using [Chat.FilterStringAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Chat/FilterStringAsync).

	 * ----------
	 * 
	 *  - Up until recently, this event didn't work on the client (in `Localscript`s), but this has been changed
	 * 
	 *  - This event does not work as expected in *solo mode*, because the player is created before scripts that connect to PlayerAdded run. To handle this case, as well as cases in which the script is added into the game after a player enters, create an OnPlayerAdded function that you can call to handle a player's entrance.

/** A Pose holds the `CFrame` applied to the `Motor6D` connected to its associated `BasePart`. The part which is controlled depends on the name of the Pose.
 * 
 * Poses are the fundamental building blocks of animations and, with `Keyframes`, make up `KeyframeSequences`.
 * 
 * ## Poses, joints and hierarchy
 * 
 * Although a Pose is assigned to a `BasePart` by name, the object manipulated during animation playback is actually the `Motor6D` connected to this part. Animation rigs branch out from the model's root part through such joints.
 * 
 * As an example. In a R15 character rig the root part is the HumanoidRootPart. The LowerTorso is connected to the HumanoidRootPart by the a motor named 'Root'. Therefore, the `CFrame` of a Pose named 'LowerTorso' in a `Keyframe` would be applied to the motor named 'Root', and not the LowerTorso itself.
 * 
 * Poses are arranged in a `Keyframe` based on joint hierarchy. This means, the Pose's `CFrame` is applied to the motor connecting the part associated with the pose to the part associated with the pose's parent. See below for a visual example of the structure of Poses on a R15 character.
 * 
 * ![][1]
 * 
 * ## Pose CFrame
 * 
 * The Roblox animation system applies [Pose.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Pose/CFrame) to the corresponding `Motor6D` by manipulating the relative transformation of the motor, the [Motor6D.Transform](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Motor6D/Transform) property.

/** A **RemoteEvent** is designed to provide a one-way message between the server and clients, allowing [Scripts](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Script) to call code in [LocalScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/LocalScript) and vice-versa. This message can be directed from one client to the server, from the server to a particular client, or from the server to all clients.
 * 
 * In order for both the server and clients to utilize a remote event, the RemoteEvent object itself must be in a place where both sides can see it. As such, we recommend that you store the RemoteEvent inside of `ReplicatedStorage`, although in some cases it's appropriate to store it in the workspace or inside a `Tool`.
 * 
 * If you need the result of the call, you should use a `RemoteFunction` instead. Otherwise a remote event is recommended since it will minimize network traffic/latency and won't yield the script to wait for a response.

/** A container whose contents are replicated to all clients (but not back to the server) first before anything else.
 * 
 * ## What is ReplicatedFirst for?
 * 
 * ReplicatedFirst is most commonly used to store `LocalScript`s and other objects that are essential for the game's start. As the contents of ReplicatedFirst replicate to the client before anything else in the game, it is ideal for creating loading GUIs or tutorials.
 * 
 * For objects that do not need to be replicated first, developers should use the `ReplicatedStorage` container instead.
 * 
 * ## How can I use ReplicatedFirst?
 * 
 * `LocalScript`s placed within ReplicatedFirst will run. This means code for custom loading screens or other ReplicatedFirst uses can be ran at the earliest possible point.
 * 
 * There a number of key considerations developers need to remember when running `LocalScript`s in ReplicatedFirst.
 * 
 *  - Its contents replicate before anything else in the game, meaning `LocalScript`s running in ReplicatedFirst will need to wait for any objects they require to replicate using [Instance.WaitForChild](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/WaitForChild)
 * 
 *  - Any objects that are to be used by a `LocalScript` in ReplicatedFirst should also be parented to ReplicatedFirst. Otherwise, they may replicate to the client late, yielding the script and negating the benefit of ReplicatedFirst.
 * 
 * ReplicatedFirst also includes the function [ReplicatedFirst.RemoveDefaultLoadingScreen](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/ReplicatedFirst/RemoveDefaultLoadingScreen), which can be used to immediately remove the default Roblox loading screen. Note if any object has been placed in ReplicatedFirst, the default loading screen will remove after 5 seconds regardless if this function has been called or not.

	 * 
	 * Name
	 * 
	 * ----------
	 * 
	 * The `name` parameter is a label for the binding, and can be used with [RunService.UnbindFromRenderStep](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/RunService/UnbindFromRenderStep) if the binding is no longer needed.
	 *

	 * RunService:UnbindFromRenderStep("tempBinding")
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * Priority
	 * 
	 * ----------
	 * 
	 * The `priority` of the binding is an integer, and determines when during the render step to call the custom function. The lower this number, the sooner the custom function will be called. If two bindings have the same priority the Roblox engine will randomly pick one to run first. The default Roblox control scripts run with these specific priorities:
	 * 
	 *  - Player Input: 100
	 * 
	 *  - Camera Controls: 200
	 * 
	 * For convenience, the [Enum.RenderPriority](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=RenderPriority) enum can be used to determine the integer value to set a binding. For example, to make a binding right before the default camera update, simply subtract 1 from the camera priority level.
	 * 
	 * > **Note:** When using Enum.RenderPriority, remember to use ***InlineCode.Value*** at the end of the desired enum. BindToRenderStep will not work if just the enum on its own is used.
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

	 * end
	 *

	 * ```
	 * 
	 * Custom Function and Delta Time
	 * 
	 * ----------
	 * 
	 * The last argument of BindToRenderStep is the `custom function` to call. This function will be passed one parameter called deltaTime. ***DeltaTime*** shows how much time passed between the beginning of the previous render step and the beginning of the current render step.
	 * 
	 * > **Note:** All rendering updates will wait until the code in the render step finishes. Make sure that any code called by BindToRenderStep runs quickly and efficiently. If code in BindToRenderStep takes too long, then the game visuals will be choppy.

	 * @param priority The *priority* of the binding is an integer, and determines when during the render step to call the custom function.

	 * 
	 * Private servers refer to the following:

	 * ## PrivateServerId vs JobId
	 *

	 * 
	 * Private servers (VIP or reserved servers) can have multiple server instances associated with them over time. This is because, although only one server instance can be running at once for a private server, new server instances can open and close as players join and leave the game. For example, no server instance is running when nobody is playing in the server. The PrivateServerId will be consistent across all of these server instances, the [DataModel.JobId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModel/JobId) will be unique for each once.

/** Smoke is one of several particle-emitting classes.

/** A `Sound` is an object that emits sound. See [Adding Sounds](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Adding%20Sounds) for more info on how to upload a sound file.
 * 
 * ## 2D and 3D Sound
 * 
 * A sound placed in a `BasePart` or an `Attachment` will emit its sound from that part's [BasePart.Position](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Position) or the attachment's [Attachment.WorldPosition](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Attachment/WorldPosition). A sound exhibits the Doppler effect, meaning its frequency and pitch varies with the relative motion of whatever attachment or part it is attached to. The volume of the sound will be determined by the distance between the client's sound listener (by default the `Camera` position) and the position of the sound's parent. For more information on this see [Sound.RollOffMode](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/RollOffMode).
 * 
 * A sound is considered "global" if it is not parented to a `BasePart` or an `Attachment`. In this case, the sound will play at the same volume throughout the entire place.
 * 
 * ## Sound Replication
 * 
 * Sound playback is not filtered. If a particular client starts playing a sound, all of the other clients will also play it unless [SoundService.RespectFilteringEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SoundService/RespectFilteringEnabled) is set to true.
 * 
 * #### Important
 * 
 * * While the playback of sounds will replicate, other properties such as the playback speed, pitch, volume, etc. will **not** replicate. This behavior can be avoided by creating all sounds locally on the client, as instancing sounds will not replicate to the server.
 * 
 * * [Sound.TimePosition](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/TimePosition), [Sound.TimeLength](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/TimeLength), and [Sound.Playing](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/Playing) will all properly replicate when set from the server.

	 * ```lua
	 * sound.RollOffMode = Enum.RollOffMode.Linear
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * Thee following options are available.
	 * 
	 *  - **Inverse:** Volume attenuates from [Sound.EmitterSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/EmitterSize) in an inverse manner
	 * 
	 *  - **InverseTapered:** A hybrid model. Follows the Inverse model when close to [Sound.EmitterSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/EmitterSize) and the Linear Square model when close to [Sound.MaxDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/MaxDistance).
	 * 
	 *  - **Linear**: Volume attenuates between [Sound.EmitterSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/EmitterSize) and [Sound.MaxDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/MaxDistance) with a linear relationship.
	 * 
	 *  - **LinearSquare:** Volume attenuates between [Sound.EmitterSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/EmitterSize) and [Sound.MaxDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/MaxDistance) with a linear squared relationship
	 * 
	 * **Inverse vs Linear Distance Attenuation**
	 * 
	 * By default sounds are set to use inverse distance attenuation (Enum.RollOffMode.Inverse) which mirrors how sounds attenuate in the real world. Under inverse distance attenuation, sounds will begin to attenuate once the distance between the listener and the Sound's parent exceeds [Sound.EmitterSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/EmitterSize). The rate of attenuation depends on the emitter size, as sounds with larger EmitterSize's will attenuate at a slower rate. Inverse rate of inverse distance attenuation is further influenced by [SoundService.RolloffScale](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SoundService/RolloffScale).
	 * 
	 * Note, [Sound.MaxDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/MaxDistance) will not effect attenuation under the inverse model but will cause the sound to cut off completely once this distance is reached. This can be particularly abrupt when using low values for max distance.
	 * 
	 * Linear distance attenuation works differently. Under linear distance attenuation the sound will attenuate between [Sound.EmitterSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/EmitterSize) and [Sound.MaxDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/MaxDistance), falling silent once MaxDistance is reached. [Sound.EmitterSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/EmitterSize) still denotes the point at which the sound will begin attenuating. However, the audible volume at any point now depends on the point the listener is at between EmitterSize and MaxDistance. This means, in contrast to the inverse distance attenuation model, the audible volume of the sound will approach silence at MaxDistance point. This is less realistic, but may be more desirable in some cases.

 * 
 * The [CompressorSoundEffect.Attack](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/CompressorSoundEffect/Attack) determines how long it takes for the compressed effect to fully apply.

 * 
 * Along with lowering the volume when the sound has passed the threshold, a compressor will also amplify the entire sound (after any threshold lowering has taken effect). This allows quieter sounds to be amplified while louder sounds can stay about the same.

/** StarterGear is a container that is automatically inserted into each `Player` when the player joins the game. When a player spawns, the contents of that player's StarterGear is copied into the player's `Backpack`. Additionally,  when a player connects to a game that permits gear, all of the appropriate gear `Tool` objects that the player owns are inserted into that player's StarterGear.
 * 
 * Unlike `StarterPack`, StarterGear is not a service but rather a child of each `Player` object -- this means that its contents are player-specific so that each player can have different `Tool`s within their `StarterGear`. It is not replicated to any client, including the owning player.
 * 
 * ## Accessing StarterGear
 * 
 * Listening to the [Players.PlayerAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Players/PlayerAdded) event is useful for
 * 
 * ```lua
 * local Players = game:GetService("Players")
 * 
 * local toolExamplePrefab = Instance.new("Tool")
 * toolExamplePrefab.Name = "Example Tool"
 * 
 * -- Accessing StarterGear from Server Script
 * local function onPlayerAdded(player)
 * 	-- Wait for the StarterGear to be added
 * 	local starterGear = player:WaitForChild("StarterGear")
 * 	-- Add a Tool to the StarterGear
 * 	local toolExample = toolExamplePrefab:Clone()
 * 	toolExample.Parent = starterGear
 * end
 * 
 * Players.PlayerAdded:connect(onPlayerAdded)
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Allowing Gear
 * 
 * Whether or not gear can be permitted is determined in a place's settings page under 'Permissions'. On the permissions page gear can be disabled and enabled by genre and type. To disable gear, ensure all the gear types are not selected.
 * 
 * Individual gear can also be added to a game using the 'Add to game' feature in the Roblox catalog. This option can be found on the page of any gear that is on sale. When gear is added to a game in this manner it will appear under the 'Store' heading on the game's page. The owner of the game (group or user) receives a commission when gear is sold in this manner.
 * 
 * ## Gameplay Considerations
 * 
 * Before adding any gear to a game, consider the implication of doing so. Gear includes `Script`s and allows the player to perform actions that the developer may not have considered. For example, a navigational gear may allow the player to access a part of the map the developer does not want to be accessed. Weapons allow players with gear to damage other players, possibly without the ability to retaliate. Always play-test games after adding gear to them to make sure there are no abuse cases.

/** A service-level container whose contents are copied into each `Player`'s `Backpack` when the player spawns. It is generally used to hold `Tools`, but is sometimes used to hold `LocalScript`s to ensure that each player gets a copy.
 * 
 * When a player's character spawns, the contents of the StarterPack and their `StarterGear` are copied into their `Backpack`. Once a character dies, the `Backpack` is removed and a new one is created -- populating it using the contents of `StarterPack` and `StarterGear`.
 * 
 * The StarterPack is used to determine a set of `Tool`s that *all* players will spawn with. If a developer wants to ensure that certain `Tool`s are available to specific players, then they will need to parent the `Tool`s directly to the player's `Backpack` instead.
 * 
 * Note: while normally the contents of `StarterPack` are predefined, the contents can be changed while the game is running by adding and removing `Tool`s accordingly. These updates will pass onto a player's backpack when they respawn and their backpacks are reloaded. Changes to the StarterPack should be made by the server.

/** The TeleportService is responsible for transporting [Players](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Player) between [places](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Place) and servers.
 * 
 * ‘Teleporting’ in Roblox, describes the transportation of [Players](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Player) between different places and servers. TeleportService provides a range of functions allowing single or groups of users to be teleported. As Roblox [games](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Multi%20Place%20Games) can contain multiple places, you can use the TeleportService to teleport players between different levels.
 * 
 * ## Which teleport function should I use?
 * 
 * A variety of teleportation functions are available and are all suitable for different circumstances:
 * 
 *  - [Teleport](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/Teleport) for teleporting a single `Player` to a place
 * 
 *  - [TeleportToSpawnByName](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/TeleportToSpawnByName) for teleporting a single `Player` to a place, spawning at a particular `SpawnLocation`
 * 
 *  - [TeleportToPlaceInstance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/TeleportToPlaceInstance) for teleporting a single `Player` to a specific server instance in a place that is part of the same game
 * 
 *  - [TeleportService.TeleportPartyAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/TeleportPartyAsync) for teleporting a group of [Players](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Player) to one server in a place that is part of the same game
 * 
 *  - [TeleportService.TeleportToPrivateServer](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/TeleportToPrivateServer) for teleporting a group of [Players](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Player) to a reserved server created using [TeleportService.ReserveServer](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/ReserveServer)

	 * 
	 *  - [GlobalDataStore.SetAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/GlobalDataStore/SetAsync) stores the data on Roblox servers whereas SetTeleportSetting stores the data locally

	 * 
	 *  - [GlobalDataStores](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GlobalDataStore) can only be accessed on the server, whereas teleport settings can only be accessed on the client
	 * 
	 *  - [GlobalDataStores](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GlobalDataStore) have usage limits, whereas teleport settings do not
	 * 
	 * In general teleport settings should be used to preserve client side information within a single play session across different places in a game. [GlobalDataStores](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GlobalDataStore) should be used to save important player data that needs to be accessed across player sessions.
	 * 
	 * ## Teleport settings and security
	 * 
	 * As teleport settings are stored locally, it is possible they can be manipulated by malicious users. This risk can be mitigated by employing server side validation, for more information on this please see the article on [Articles.Game Security](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Game%20Security).

	 * 
	 * This function should only be used on the client. If the teleportation function is called from the server (as is the case with [TeleportService.TeleportPartyAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/TeleportPartyAsync)) then this function should be called on the client prior to this. One way of doing this is listening to a `RemoteEvent` that fires several seconds before teleportation.
	 * 
	 * ```lua

	 *

	 * You may only teleport players to places within the same game or active start places for other games.
	 * 
	 * ## Teleport data
	 * 
	 * A *teleportData* parameter can be specified. This is data the client will transmit to the destination place and can be retrieved using [TeleportService.GetLocalPlayerTeleportData](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/GetLocalPlayerTeleportData).
	 * 
	 * The *teleportData* can take any of the following forms:
	 * 
	 *  - A table without mixed keys (all keys are strings or integers)
	 * 
	 *  - A string
	 * 
	 *  - A number
	 * 
	 *  - A bool
	 * 
	 * As the *teleportData* is transmitted by the client it is not secure. For this reason it should only be used for local settings and not sensitive items (such as the users’ score or in-game currency).
	 * 
	 * If you need teleport data to persist across multiple teleports, you can use [TeleportService.SetTeleportSetting](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/SetTeleportSetting) and [TeleportService.GetTeleportSetting](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/GetTeleportSetting).
	 * 
	 * ## Loading screen
	 * 
	 * A *customLoadingScreen* argument can be specified. This is a `ScreenGui` that is copied (without scripts) into the `CoreGui` of the destination place.
	 * 
	 * Note, [TeleportService.SetTeleportGui](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/SetTeleportGui) is the preferred alternative to the *customLoadingScreen* argument as it can be called prior to the teleport.
	 * 
	 * The loading `ScreenGui` can be obtained in the destination place using [TeleportService.GetArrivingTeleportGui](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/GetArrivingTeleportGui), where developers can parent it to the `PlayerGui`. It will not be used if the destination place is in a different game.
	 * 
	 * ## Teleport failure
	 * 
	 * In some circumstances a teleport may fail. This can be due to the developer configuring the teleport incorrectly or issues with Roblox’s servers.
	 * 
	 *  - If a teleportation request is rejected the [TeleportService.TeleportInitFailed](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/TeleportService/TeleportInitFailed) event will fire the error message and a [Enum.TeleportResult](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=TeleportResult) enumerator describing the issue
	 * 
	 *  - Teleports can fail ‘in transit’, after the user has left the server, due to issues with Roblox’s servers. In this case the user will be shown an error message and be required to rejoin the game
	 * 
	 * ## Alternative teleport functions
	 * 
	 * Before using Teleport, you should check to see if an alternative teleport function is more suitable:
	 * 
	 *  - [TeleportService.TeleportToSpawnByName](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/TeleportToSpawnByName) is used to teleport a player to a place and spawn them at a specific `SpawnLocation`
	 * 
	 *  - [TeleportService.TeleportPartyAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/TeleportPartyAsync) is used to teleport a group of players together to the same server
	 * 
	 *  - [TeleportService.TeleportToPlaceInstance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/TeleportToPlaceInstance) is used to teleport a player to a specific server in a place
	 * 
	 *  - [TeleportService.TeleportToPrivateServer](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/TeleportToPrivateServer) is used to teleport a player to a reserved server created using [TeleportService.ReserveServer](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/ReserveServer)

	 * 
	 *  - This function may fail to return the correct information if the user is teleporting
	 * 
	 *  - It is possible for this function to throw an error, hence developers should wrap it in a pcall (see example below)
	 * 
	 *  - As this function returns the [DataModel.JobId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModel/JobId) of the server and not the access code returned by [TeleportService.ReserveServer](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/ReserveServer) the id returned is not appropriate for use with reserved servers

	 * 
	 * ## Reserved Servers
	 * 
	 * The following are characteristics of reserved servers:
	 * 
	 *  - They can only be accessed using [TeleportService.TeleportToPrivateServer](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/TeleportToPrivateServer), with the access code ReserveServer returns
	 * 
	 *  - A game server is started when the access code is first used
	 * 
	 *  - No more than one game server instance can exist at any time for each access code
	 * 
	 *  - Access codes remain valid indefinitely, meaning reserved servers can still be joined if no game server is running (in this case a new game server will be started)
	 *

	 * 
	 * ## Teleport data
	 * 
	 * A *teleportData* parameter can be specified. This is data the clients will transmit to the destination place and can be retrieved using [TeleportService.GetLocalPlayerTeleportData](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/GetLocalPlayerTeleportData).

	 * 
	 *  - A string
	 * 
	 *  - A number
	 * 
	 *  - A bool
	 * 
	 * As the *teleportData* is transmitted by the client it is not secure. For this reason it should only be used for local settings and not sensitive items (such as the users’ score or in-game currency).
	 * 
	 * ## Loading screen
	 * 
	 * A *customLoadingScreen* argument can be specified. This is a `ScreenGui` that is copied (without scripts) into the `CoreGui` of the destination place. It can be retrieved at the destination place using [TeleportService.GetArrivingTeleportGui](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/GetArrivingTeleportGui) and will not be used if the destination place is in a different game.
	 * 
	 * You are advised to instead set the loading screen on the client using [TeleportService.SetTeleportGui](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/SetTeleportGui). The loading `ScreenGui` should also be parented to the [Players'](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Player) [PlayerGuis](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/PlayerGui) a few seconds before the teleport to ensure a smooth transition using a `RemoteEvent`. For an example of this see [SetTeleportGui](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TeleportService/SetTeleportGui).

	 * 
	 * During a teleport, whilst the destination place is loading, the *customLoadingScreen* is parented to the `CoreGui`.

	 * 
	 * If you wish to preserve the *customLoadingScreen* and perform your own transitions, you will need to parent it to the [LocalPlayer’s](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Players/LocalPlayer) `PlayerGui`. For example, using the following code inside a `LocalScript` in `ReplicatedFirst`:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")
	 * local Players = game:GetService("Players")
	 * local ReplicatedFirst = game:GetService("ReplicatedFirst")

	 * 
	 * ## Usage
	 * 
	 * This method should be called once each time a user submits a message. Do not cache the results of this function and re-use them for separate messages. If a user submits the same text multiple times this method must be called again each time the message is sent. If the results are cached and reused spam detection and many forms of context-aware filtering will be broken and potentially put user safety at risk. Games that improperly use cached results may face moderation.
	 * 
	 * However, it is encouraged to keep these result objects to display the same message to users who join the server later. For example: this can be used to safely and efficiently implement a server chat log that always uses the least restrictive filtering for users who join later, or for efficiently displaying text like a pet name to a user who joins the game after the pet was first spawned and name filtered.
	 * 
	 * The optional [Enum.TextFilterContext](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=TextFilterContext) parameter will not impact the filtered result of the query. This value will be used to improve Roblox's text filtering.
	 * 
	 * Private text is anything that is seen only by specific players, rather than every player. For example, if the chat is seen by a single player, or by a selected group of players, then the chat is considered private. Chat for teams or chat that is potentially visible to a wider group, such as the server, is considered public. If you are unsure what your text qualifies as, leave the optional field blank.
	 * 
	 * ## Notes
	 * 
	 *  - This method always yields to make a text filtering service call
	 * 
	 *  - This method may throw if there is a service error that can not be resolved. If this function throws an error please do not retry the request; this method implements it’s own retry logic internally. If this method fails do not display the text to any user.
	 * 
	 *  - This method currently throws if *fromUserId* is not online on the current server. We plan to support users who are offline or on a different server in the future.
	 * @param stringToFilter The text to be filtered.
	 * @param fromUserId The userId of the player filtering the text.
	 * @param textContext The context that the filtered message will be used in. The default is PrivateChat.
	 * @returns Can be used to distribute the correctly filtered text accordingly.

 *

 * 
 * ![Basic Trail][3]
 * 
 * It is common practice to either store the Trail in the `BasePart` containing the effect's attachments, or as a child of a `Folder` in the Workspace with other effects objects.

/** The `UserInputService` is a service used to detect and capture the different types of input available on a user’s device.
 * 
 * The primary purpose of this service is to allow for games to cooperate with multiple forms of available input - such as gamepads, touch screens, and keyboards. It allows a `LocalScript` to perform different actions depending on the device, and in turn, helps developers provide the best experience for the end user.
 * 
 * Some usages of this service include detecting user input when they interact with GUIs, tools, and other game instances. In order to detect user input, the service must look for a service event. For example, the service can detect events such as when the user touches the screen of a mobile device using [UserInputService.TouchStarted](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/UserInputService/TouchStarted), or connects a gamepad such as an Xbox controller to their device using [UserInputService.GamepadConnected](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/UserInputService/GamepadConnected).
 * 
 * Since this service is client-side only, it will only work when used in a `LocalScript` or a `ModuleScript` required by a `LocalScript`. As UserInputService is client-side only, users in the game can only detect their own input - and not the input of others.

It returns true if the [gamepad](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=UserInputType) has the specified [button](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=KeyCode) pressed down, otherwise it returns false.
	 * 
	 * ## Valid UserInputTypes
	 * 
	 * The specified gamepad should be one of the following UserInputType enum values:
	 * 
	 * | Name |
	 * | --- |
	 * | Enum.UserInputType.Gamepad1-8< |  |
	 * 
	 * ## Valid KeyCodes
	 * 
	 * The specified button should be one of the following KeyCodes enum values:
	 * 
	 * | Name |
	 * | --- |
	 * | Enum.KeyCode.ButtonX< |  |
	 * | Enum.KeyCode.ButtonY< |  |
	 * | Enum.KeyCode.ButtonA< |  |
	 * | Enum.KeyCode.ButtonB< |  |

	 * | Enum.KeyCode.ButtonStart< |  |
	 * | Enum.KeyCode.ButtonSelect< |  |
	 * | Enum.KeyCode.DPadLeft< |  |
	 * | Enum.KeyCode.DPadRight< |  |
	 * | Enum.KeyCode.DPadUp< |  |
	 * | Enum.KeyCode.DPadDown< |  |
	 * 
	 * This can be used to check whether a specific button, such as A, is being held down. For example:
	 * 
	 * ```lua
	 * local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")
	 * 
	 * local button = Enum.KeyCode.ButtonA
	 * local gamepad = Enum.UserInputType.Gamepad1

/** The VRService is a service that is responsible for handling interactions between Roblox and Virtual Reality (VR). If you're interested in incorporating VR compatibility into your game, this is the service for you!
 * 
 * The primary purpose of this service is to allow for games to communication and cooperate with virtual reality decisions - such as VR headsets and controllers. It allows a LocalScript to perform different actions depending on the device, and in turn, helps developers provide the best experience for the end user seeking to experience Roblox using VR devices.
 * 
 * Some usages of this service include detecting whether a user has any connected VR devices, tracking when those devices move, and determining how those devices interact with the user's in-game controls. In order to detect user input, the service must look for a service event. For example, the service can detect  VR device movement via events such as [VRService.UserCFrameChanged](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/VRService/UserCFrameChanged).
 * 
 * Notes
 * 
 * ----------
 * 
 *  1. The `UserInputService` also contains several events and functions useful for enhancing a player's VR experience in your game.
 * 
 *  2. Since this service is client-side only, it will only work when used in a `LocalScript`. It will not work when used within a `Script`. Client-side only means that users in the game can only detect their own input - and not the input of other users.

/** **WeldConstraints** are used to attach two [parts](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/BasePart) together. The constraint makes sure that the parts stay in the same relative position and orientation to one another. This means that if one part moves, the other will move the same amount. Even if the two parts are not touching one another, they can be welded together with a WeldConstraint.
 * 
 * ## Creating WeldConstraints
 * 
 * The most common way to create a WeldConstraint is through the Studio tool. This tool is in the Model tab under the **Create** dropdown.
 * 
 * ![Create Weld Constraint][1]
 * 
 * This tool will act differently based on how many parts are selected when the tool is activated.
 * 
 * ### No Parts Selected
 * 
 * If no parts are selected when the Weld tool is clicked, the next two parts that are clicked on will be welded together. If the same part is clicked twice no weld will be created.
 * 
 * ### One Part Selected
 * 
 * If one part is selected when the Weld tool is clicked, the next part that is clicked on will be welded to the selected part.
 * 
 * ### Multiple Parts Selected
 * 
 * If several parts are selected when the Weld tool is clicked, any parts in that selection that are touching or overlapping will be welded together.
 * 
 * ## Repositioning Welded Parts
 * 
 * Roblox handles moving a welded part differently depending on whether the part was moved using its Position or with its CFrame. If a welded part’s Position is updated, the part will move but none of the connected parts will move with it. The weld will recalculate the offset from the other part based on the part’s new position.
 * 
 * ```lua
 * -- Create two parts and position them at the same height
 * local partA = Instance.new("Part")
 * local partB = Instance.new("Part")
 * partA.Position = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
 * partB.Position = Vector3.new(0, 10, 10)
 * partA.Parent = game.Workspace
 * partB.Parent = game.Workspace
 * 
 * -- Weld the two parts together
 * local weld = Instance.new("WeldConstraint")
 * weld.Parent = game.Workspace
 * weld.Part0 = partA
 * weld.Part1 = partB
 * 
 * -- Update the position of the first part. The first part
 * -- will move but the second will stay where it started. The
 * -- weld maintain the new offset
 * partA.Position = Vector3.new(0, 20, 0)
 * ```
 * 
 * If instead a part's CFrame is updated, then that part will move and any part welded to that part will also move. These other parts will be moved to make sure they maintain the same offset as when the weld was created.
 * 
 * ```lua
 * -- Create two parts and position them at the same height
 * local partA = Instance.new("Part")
 * local partB = Instance.new("Part")
 * partA.Position = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
 * partB.Position = Vector3.new(0, 10, 10)
